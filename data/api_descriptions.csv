arma-ii-operation-arrowhead,9495.0,"This expansion pack to 2009's ARMA 2 features a standalone plot and setting and does not require installing the original game. Operation Arrowhead is set in an alternative 2012 in Takistan, a made-up mountainous Asian country reminiscent of Afghanistan. The protagonists are the NATO forces consisting of American, Czech and German military. Their mission is to overthrow the corrupt regime of colonel Muhammad Aziz and to protect neighboring (equally fictional) Karzeghistan from a Tatkistani invasion. The player will lead them through a series of battles in the desert, highland, and urban environment. At the various stages of the game, the player will control not only foot soldiers but also tanks and helicopters. Operation Arrowhead adds certain new features to ARMA 2 gameplay. The expansion introduces additional vehicles and weapons, enhanced infrared vision, removable backpacks, and drones that can also be controlled by the player. There are also DLCs that allow you to add British soldiers and a private military company. The game is considered quite hardcore by its difficulty, even for experienced gamers, so it is recommended to complete a tutorial stage at the beginning."
blood-bowl-legendary-edition,11751.0,"Blood Bowl is an ultra-violent fantasy football simulator inspired by the Warhammer universe. The game was created in 1986 as a parody of a real sport and for a long time existed in a desktop format. The primary goal of the game is to deliver the ball to the enemy's score-zone. You can do this in two ways: to run into it or give a pass. The turn lasts until the player performs an action by all the characters. The Legendary Edition includes 20 races, 11 of which appear in the game for the first time. Each race involves unique gameplay. Matches take place in the form of a crazy mix of turn-based combat and a sports simulator. Players noted the high difficulty of the game and its dependence on a successful dice roll: even the most simple move can fail due to a bad throw. In the career mode, the player is encouraged to start building his own team from scratch, buying new players, cheerleaders and additional coaches."

Now, when the American government hunted him, Michael uses ""Alpha Protocol"" - a secret program that recruited him and begins to work to detect the conspiracy secretly. Alpha Protocol gives you the ability to take control of Thorton with a camera from a third-person perspective (you can see all that surrounds you). The CIA trained Thorton, so at his disposal is possession of weapons of ranged and melee, as well as technical devices. The player also earns promotion points, which increase skills in using guns and give additional abilities. Alpha Protocol provides the ability to interact with numerous characters in the game. Conversations take place in real time, thus giving to the player some time to answer in essential dialogues."

In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies’ checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict’s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes’ equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat."

According to its owner, it is hidden under a video game store and is kept secret so that if the government outlaws gambling one day, it will know nothing of Inventory. The player does not control any of the characters but is instead an invisible character on its own, who is literally referred to as The Player by other characters. All players have a reserve of $10,000 at the beginning and leave the game if they're left nothing to put at stake. The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table. Sometimes the opponents will put their recognizable belongings, such as Heavy's iconic bazooka Iron Curtain, at stake. This is essentially a board game, however, funny animation and characters' chit-chat filled with references and jokes may keep one interested.

Our swashbuckling sausage-dog star is Gaius James Rover, son of the famous clown Jolly Rover, who died from a blow to the groin from an improperly loaded joke cannon. Following the tragically comedic death of his father, young Gaius, who insists on using his middle name James, goes to live with his uncle, a wealthy plantation owner on a small Caribbean island. While practising a particularly tricky juggling move, he accidentally taints a barrel of rum with tobacco, creating a potent and addictive brew which he coins ‘Jolly Rover’, one of the most prized substances in the Caribbean. Alas, the wealth of Jolly Rover sales only manages to fill the pockets of his uncle, and Gaius longs for action and adventure and, more importantly, the opportunity to start his own circus and follow in the footsteps of his father. It is not long before the fumbled juggling ball of opportunity raps Gaius smartly on the head yet again. While his uncle is away, a large contract for Jolly Rover arrives from Guy DeSilver, Governor of the notorious Groggy Island, with payment upfront! In a blinding flurry of optimism, Gaius pools his meagre savings with this advance and charters a ship and crew to take him to Groggy Island. Along the way he meets a colourful band of seafaring cutthroats, scallywags and rogues otherwise known as pirates. It is here we begin to follow the short and stubby tail of Gaius across three wild and untamed tropical islands, as he attempts to fulfil his dream of starting a circus, hampered only by pirates, villains, voodoo, love and considerable lack of loot.

beat-hazard,18347.0,"Beat Hazard is a game in which everything is synchronized to your favorite music. Gameplay-wise, it’s a regular 2D shoot ’em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks. What makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player’s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot ’em up. Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness. The game’s visuals are very bright and feature many rapid flashes, which makes Beat Hazard not recommended for people with epilepsy."

You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her... Portal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay.

limbo,1030.0,"This popular 2D puzzle-platformer creates the atmosphere of isolation, where the player alone can guide the nameless protagonist to his destination. Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks. Limbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre. The simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do."

The game offers 148 cars from 36 manufacturers and 35 different tracks on which players can compete in several types of races. The game is not overloaded with plot details, not directly related to car racing. The main character is a novice racer who wants to become a champion - and that’s it!

Much has been done in these things easier than one might have expected. At the same time, the game is a full-fledged car racing simulator - you need to control different cars in different ways, in full dependence on engine power, front or rear wheel drive, as well as on tuned systems installed on the car, parts and corresponding settings. Even one detail can significantly change the ride.

Finally, if the car and the pilot get into such an accident, in which the camera should break, it breaks and the player’s point of view returns to normal observation. Training Hey, it’s not a bad idea. champion. In the career mode, players learn driving skills from reputable teachers, with a total of about ten world-class instructors in the game.

Time, situation, character The game takes place in 2070, when the ecological situation in the world has become so serious that it cannot be completely ignored and the attitude to the environment becomes a key point in the development of corporations, on whose activity the well-being of humanity is based. The game has implemented some of the gloomiest predictions about global warming: the world ocean level has risen so much that the continents have gone under water, and people have only to swim between the remaining islets on huge floating ark cities. You control the captain of such an ark - and this means that you will have to explore, discover and colonize islands, build trade routes, build cities, meet the needs of the population, mine and mine food, build all kinds of enterprises, mines and fleets. Gameplay The entire Anno series is characterized by a general scheme - the player has to develop unpopulated but resource-rich territories, adjusting their economies, and then move on in search of new undeveloped territories. In the Anno 2070 there is the same scheme, but its concrete implementation this time focuses on maintaining the ecological balance during colonization. Various approaches to this problem embody the main actors in the game: - the classic industrial tycoons from the Global Trust Corporation - rely on coal and nuclear power plants - the environmentally-minded governing bodies of the Eden Initiative Corporation - these people rely more on renewable energy sources, wind energy or falling water. The magnates, if you go their way, provide a more rapid development, but the population is dissatisfied with the deterioration of living conditions. Environmentalists are developing more slowly, but the situation becomes softer. But not everything is so primitive - both the magnates and the environmentalists have no ready answers to all the questions. Environmentalists also have to deal with environmental pollution, and the magnates, if they wish, can build waste treatment plants and make their strategies more acceptable. In addition, the game has a third force - scientists who can significantly change the balance of forces with their technologies. It is technologies, a powerful factor that can change a lot, became the second significant difference in the game setting after the need to preserve the ecological balance during colonization. In addition to these three main factions, there are many other actors in the game: pirates, free traders, mercenaries, an oil baron named Sukhov, a Japanese oceanographer and others. You can interact with all of them - trade, negotiate, ask for help, carry out their tasks, receiving scarce licenses for the purchase of technologies as a reward. Multiplayer Multiplayer mode allows you to bring into the game a lot of interaction in social networks. Players can form alliances, choose each other in the Senate, and then vote in the Senate for certain laws."

xenonauts,13249.0,"Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped ""ports"" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable."

renegade-ops,4612.0,"A rare opportunity to so wholly quench the thirst for total destruction. The game understands this desire and does everything to make it happen. Yes, there is a story in the game, but the main thing is that there are tremendous opportunities to see on the screen a bright consequence of all your destructive impulses. Your small car or helicopter rushes around the locations, bringing down the streams of fire. The game reality is repeatedly and colourfully detonated from every touch. The game continually offers more and more appetising victims - cars, flying and swimming devices, limousines and buildings, which can be destroyed entirely or in pieces, inflicting wounds one by one or killing with one blow. It is clear that you are busy with all these mass destructions so you cannot observe the rules of the road - the game is favourably treated with the manner of your car to fly into a skid or to demolish fences not only by guns but also by bumpers. Navigation and management are also skillfully designed - and intended to not to distract you from the massacre."

fable-iii,28631.0,"Set half a century after the ending of Fable II, the third part sees the fantasy kingdom of Albion dramatically changed. The scientific progress has come, bringing new machines, factories, firearms, gaslight, steampunk aesthetics and a new way of life. And the Industrial Revolution is about to provoke the actual revolution. Too many people in the kingdom are not content with the changes and are about to overthrow the current king, who is also the main character's brother. Unlike the previous game, you are an aristocrat from the very beginning. It is up to you to take action and save your homeland this way or another, and it depends on you if your character is remembered as a wise and just leader or an evil tyrant.

Compared to Fable II, social interactions with NPC became simpler and more straightforward. It is usually enough to be nice to people to make them like you, or even fall in love with you. To make an engagement, however, you will have to complete certain quests."

edge-2011,597.0,"Edge is an isometric puzzle platformer. You control a cube and need to lead it through levels to the goal, collecting light prisms and trying not to fall off the map. You see the map from the isometric perspective, and the cube moves diagonally. There are 45 main and 3 unlockable levels in the game. The key feature of the gameplay is the ability of the cube to balance at the certain angle. You need this to complete the most difficult parts of the route. When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master. However, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it’s quite difficult to perform this safely. Problems can appear only with collecting all the prisms as they can be hidden. In general, the entire game is created in simple polygonal style so nothing distracts you from completing levels."

Yet this warlock is just a pawn in the greater game of a demon Assatur, who wants to destroy wants to destroy the homeland of the mages.

fear-3,5565.0,"The third game of the FEAR series of games. The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named ""Operative"", and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear. Protagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people. The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is ""turned on"" during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger."

Anjali is a shape-shifter who is a combination of both, depending on her current form, and Reinhart is a classic magician who uses energy spells.

serious-sam-the-random-encounter,19306.0,"One of three games in the universe of Serious Sam from independent developers. They had the opportunity to create a game in a recognizable setting, and the publisher can promote a new take in the Serius Sam series. The game tries to embrace the action-packed action of the big games but in the RPG genre. Visually it resembles the classic jRPG but plays differently. Battles are all also turn-based like in the reference, but by using an object or weapon, the player has to move the main character and hit the enemies, dodging their attacks. As the name implies, the main battles take place after random encounters. The main character can be joined by new characters, at levels you can find new weapons. At the end of each level, the player will face a boss battle. The game quite accurately adheres to the style of the series: a vast number of enemies appears on the screen simultaneously. The game is rather short. The story campaign is only available for solo completion."
hydrophobia-prophecy,4560.0,"Hydrophobia Prophecy is an improved version of the game Hydrophobia, designed for the PlayStation 3 and Steam. Hydrophobia Prophecy includes both new levels (updated approximately 70% of the content) and levels already exist, but have undergone significant processing. Both the original and the reworked version of the game are created as part of the action-adventure genre with elements of survival horror in the cyberpunk style. Place and time of action The game takes place in the middle of the XXI century. By this time, the world is plunged into chaos caused by great overpopulation. Lands suitable for food production are destroyed by rising ocean levels and the spread of deserts. Hunger and misery reign in the world. The most precious resource of humanity in these conditions is simple drinking water. The game takes place on board a giant cruise liner comparable in size to the city. The liner is called Queen of the World, it was built by a group of giant corporations to create comfortable conditions for the elected representatives from among the managers of these corporations. History At the very beginning of the game, a group of terrorists is attacking and seizing a ship. The terrorists call themselves ""Neo Malthusians"" (after the economist Thomas Malthus, who predicted the death of humanity from overpopulation). They plan to kill many people so that the world will return to a state fit for a full life. Attacking the liner, the terrorists painted the walls with their slogans, the same slogans are broadcast on screens all over the ship. One of the slogans: “Save the World - Kill Yourself!”. The terrorists are attacking a diner to get a tool for global genocide, killing about 10 billion people - such tools are in the secret laboratories of one of the Five Corporations located on the liner - “NanoCell Corporation”. The protagonist, system engineer of the ship Kate Wilson, was responsible for the safety of the liner - when as a result of an attack by terrorists the ship begins to sink, Kate seeks to survive and tries to prevent the terrorists. What she needs for this, too, is in these secret laboratories. Gameplay One of the creators of the game described the gameplay as a “player against the environment”, meaning, first of all, water - water constantly interacts with everything it comes in contact with, and it gives an incredible variety of situations, sets of options for changing circumstances. Water floods the liner, constantly changing the configuration of spaces suitable for action and movement. The player must constantly adapt to this and respond quickly. Other characters can also affect the situation, and this effect also leads to a redistribution and movement of water. Water may involve other objects and substances in its actions — for example, a gasoline stain that has spread through water may ignite and burn, while water carries these fiery stains throughout the ship. The action can occur both on the surface of the water and in its thickness. HydroEngine, an engine capable of solving this problem with unprecedented realism, was created to simulate flowing water in all its variety for the game."

king-arthur-fallen-champions,14769.0,"The great King Arthur has crushed his adversaries in the South but the realm of the Once and Future King still has its limit. The lands beyond the Forest of Bedegraine are wild, ruled by no one, haunted by the old gods who fought and bled here in times long past. Fallen Champions bridges the gap between King Arthur I and II with a tale of three brave souls. Sir Lionel, a brave knight from Britannia on a quest to rescue a damsel in distress. Lady Corrigan of the Sidhe, a creature of the twilight seeking the secret pathways that could lead her back to her lost home of Tir na nÓg. The third is Drest the Chosen, a shaman of the North, driven by visions of greatness and voices in the night. A knight, an enchantress, and a prophet - these three will become champions of a forgotten battle that began long, long ago. Core Gameplay The gameplay relies on a story-based, mission-to-mission plot. Players will choose missions and upgrade heroes. The Fallen Champions Campaign Map covers one specific region of Britannia, where players command three very different heroes. Each hero has his own storyline and each of these story lines incorporates three battles, adding up to a total of nine skirmishes plus the confrontation with the major foe in the 10th battle. The battle maps are very diverse both in visuals and in construction: some tactical-RPG situations (with a limited number of elite units and heroes), tactical battles (with huge armies on the field) and massive battles against a general AI under very unusual circumstances. Key features: Follow three unique heroes, each with their own storyline featuring adventure quests and epic fights. The fates of these three heroes are intertwined, and their quests lead up to one massive battle under extraordinary circumstances A variety of battle types fought on unique, beautifully crafted battlemaps, ranging from smaller tactical skirmishes to grand engagements against superior numbers A dark and gripping fantasy tale that bridges the gap between King Arthur and King Arthur II, set in an ancient region of Britannia, beyond the well-known territories of King Arthur – The Role-playing Wargame"
duke-nukem-forever,4483.0,"Duke Nukem is a larger-than-life macho who smokes cigars, speaks in one-liners and has a kink for hot girls and big guns. Twelve years ago, Duke defeated invading aliens and became a worldwide celebrity, but now another invasion forces him to go out of the retirement. He has to save all the Earth's women, who are being kidnapped by aliens. Most weapons are the same as in the original game. However, this time Duke cannot carry all his arsenals and is restricted to only two weapons at a time. He can also use “holoduke”, a holographic version of himself, to distract enemies. Duke restores his health over time using a new mechanic of “ego bar” — a measurement of Duke’s enormous ego that needs to be bolstered. This belated sequel to Duke Nukem 3D spent 15 years in development, so it may feel like an artifact from another era. This is especially obvious from the game’s vulgar black humor. The protagonist may urinate, drink beer, and tell somewhat chauvinistic jokes about women. There's also controversial Capture the Babe multiplayer mode, based on ""capture the flag"" mechanic, but instead of flags, there are girls that have to be spanked."

Such conflicts serve as the leitmotif through the entirety of a game — not only we are choosing sides to fight on in the Civil War, but also we are facing the decisions of choosing Assassins' or Templar's side. As it is common in the Assasin's Creed games, the gameplay concentrates profoundly around fighting the multiple enemies all at once, parkouring off walls and micro-management: selling resources, exchanging ships and so on.

chaos-on-deponia,15713.0,"The second game in the Deponia series is set in a whimsically cartoonish future world and is defined by its emphasis on characters and humor. Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you. Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia."

giana-sisters-twisted-dreams,3987.0,"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas. You play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a ""Cutie"" and a ""Punk"", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds. A definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and ""heavy"" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature."

Players can access only one dimension at a time."
endless-space,41457.0,"Endless Space is like Civilization set in space: a turn-based 4X global strategy in the vein of Master of Orion. The player assumes control over a powerful galactic empire, either by choosing one of the existing factions with its predefined attributes or by customizing all attributes from scratch. There are eight playable sci-fi civilizations that vary from different types of humans to sentient birds and amoebas. The gameplay lets you explore the randomly generated galaxy, colonize planets, discover technologies, build starfleets and fight the other civilizations for control over star systems. You can conquer the galaxy by force, however, as in Civilization, there are other types of victory that can be achieved, including Economic and Diplomatic. The combat system is unusual and uses a card based mechanic: both sides play their virtual “cards”, and the animated ships re-enact the result. There are also heroes, the special units that can serve as military commanders or civilian leaders and improve a certain sphere under their influence. The maps allow up to eight players, who can be AI-controlled opponents, actual players in the multiplayer mode, or both."

ys-origin,249.0,"700 years before the events of Ys I & II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether.

prototype-2,3226.0,"The succsessor Prototype 2 - developed by Radical Entertainment is a science-fiction adventure shooter with a third-person view in the open world. The publisher was Activision, and the game was released on April 24, 2012, on PS3 and Xbox 360, and then, on July 24, 2012, on PC. Later, in August 2015, it was released on consoles of the next generation - PS4 and Xbox One. The setting The action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones. The player will try on the role of Sergeant James Heller, who serves in the Middle East. It all begins at the moment when his wife calls and says that the epidemic has begun again in the city and they are at the epicenter with their daughter. Returning home, James discovers that his family is dead and now his task is to find someone who, in his opinion, is the culprit of these deaths. Key features Cruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn’t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game’s universe."

dear-esther,18712.0,"Dear Esther is a game that questions the very concept of a ""game"" as an entertainment. It is more of an art project that was originally started as a mod on the Source engine (the one Half-Life 2 is based on). The player assumes the role of a nameless and faceless character, a man, who wanders around a cold island at the shores of Scotland. When you enter certain parts of the island, the main character reads aloud his letters from the past, revealing his tragic story. All other characters, including the protagonists’ wife Esther, are only mentioned by the narrator and do not appear in the game. There's very little actual gameplay, and your goal as a player is to explore the island and discover as many parts of the backstory as possible. The goal of the game is to follow the story, immerse yourself in the experience and pass it through your emotions. Dear Esther is famous for its visual design and sound: there are gorgeous natural landscapes (the caves in particular), ambient sounds, and music. Melancholic mood and darkened landscapes befit the story that is all about loss and grief."

It is the second installment in the self-titled series, preceded by Edna & Harvey: The Breakout released three years prior — in 2008. Both games' setting is the 2D comic world. The game design feature of the game is an absence of bars with the actions, usually to the genre. Gameplay only allows speaking with the other characters, choosing the corresponding emotional reaction (much like a dialogue wheel in Mass Effect series) and connect objects within the inventory. The story follows Lilli — the protagonist of the game. The setting is the female school in some Abbey. After the news of a probable brainwash, the main character and some other pupils decide to expose corrupted school officials. The story, like this, tracks themes of a problematic youth, father-and-son issues, and adolescent disobedience. The game features three endings: the player is free to choose any one with their choices not affecting the outcome."
scribblenauts-unlimited,7317.0,"The fourth game in the Scribblenauts series follows the same basic mechanics as the previous three. You play as Max, who owns a magic notebook. Scribe any word in it, and it becomes real (of course, only if the word you wrote describes a particular object). The game will understand your written words and create interactive in-game objects. They are used to solve puzzles, which earns you Starites, the ultimate goal of the game. The ability to summon any imaginable item gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle. Scribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors. There's an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist's motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior."
blacklight-retribution,3843.0,"Blacklight: Retribution is a multiplayer only game in the cyberpunk setting, a direct sequel to Blacklight: Tango Down. Aside from the tutorial level and matches against bots with human teammates, there is no single player content. Current game modes include not only staples of the genre like Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill, but there is also a twist on the formula in case of Kill Confirmed mode. Players will have to kill enemies, but in order for the kill to count, it’s necessary to collect tokens from them. Teammates can pick up tokens from their friends in order to deny the kill points for the enemy team. Later added Onslaught and Siege modes brought more gimmick objective-based gameplay to the game. Total of sixteen maps of different sizes, complexity, and styles, which on top of the fully customizable equipment and appearances allows players to find unique look and playstyle, fitting for them."
iron-brigade,16224.0,"Iron Brigade (formerly Trenched) is a third-person tower defense in the setting of the World War I. Gameplay The main ""hero"" of the action is Trench — thus the former name — which is a warrior-robotic creature defending the player's base from the upcoming waves of enemies with escalating difficulty. In contrary to the typical games of the genre, there is only one unit modifying itself according to the mission's needs. The trench is highly moveable — the placement can be changed to bent a course of the battle towards the victory. The broken machines can be repaired, and the goal of almost every level is to defend U.S.S. McKinley base. The game does not feature any difficulty settings and playable in cooperative mode. After the primary campaign, there are survival missions available. Plot The game swiftly changes its settings from the absurd, dieselpunk variation of the World War I to the anti-Russian campaign set somewhere on Mars with no storyline tying these events whatsoever. The mission giveaway is monotonous, and the whole story centers around the scheme including fighting with the mobs, fighting with the boss of the location, walking down to the headquarters and acquiring new quest with the seemingly little bonds to the previous one — the scheme repeats itself until the end of the story."
the-dark-eye-chains-of-satinav,16252.0,"Boardgames are fun! The adventure game in the point-and-click genre from the German studio Daedalic Entertainment.

Being the object of ridicule of the whole town, the boy does simply not despair, but, on the contrary, tries to overcome circumstances by the only possible weapon for this - smartness. And he unwittingly becomes part of a swirl of events. Key features In the classic for the genre manner (point the cursor, click on the button and something will happen or not) the player will have to plunge into the world that is perfectly worked, thanks to the extensive game universe. The plot is twisted so that you do not even need to be a quest lover in order to want to understand what will happen next - on the next screen. The game is designed in such a way that it will, on the one hand, win the confidence of newcomers, allowing them to retain them thanks to a system of tips, and on the other - not to frighten regulars of the genre with their simplicity. And of course - the balance between the comic and the seriousness of the events taking place will allow the player to go into the plot and feel the atmosphere."

they-bleed-pixels,13339.0,"They Bleed Pixels is a 2D hardcore platformer featuring pixel art stylistics borrowed from Lovecraft compositions. This is the only title within the franchise.

The death is common here as there are numerous ghastly obstacles along the level. Although the game features checkpoints they are only created when enough enemies' blood is accumulated within the heroine. So, the location without encounters means the place without checkpoints as well. Plot The story examines the adventures of a little teenager who enters a special school for girls only — Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies. The only difference is — the action takes place within her nightmares where she is forced to fight numerous squads of demons. After every level, the girl wakes up and through the course of the plot she begins noticing changes occurring to her real self, which are gained from her nightmares.

megabyte-punch,16943.0,"In Megabyte Punch, the player controls a robot who fights fellow robots for spare parts. It combines elements from various genres, such as beat'em up and platformers. Plot The main protagonist is an unnamed robotic creature that lives in a colorful world of robots. The character tries to defend its village from enemies from such factions as Valk Empire and Khoteps. Its goal is to beat multiple robots to reach the enemy leaders and defeat them. Gameplay The game is a side-scroller, in which the player leads his or her robot through levels and fights enemies. The protagonist has two types of attacks, one is basic, and the other is special. There are six zones, or ""worlds"" in Megabyte Punch, each divided into three levels. Curiously, the local robots realize that they live in the game's levels and refer to them as such. Each world ends with a boss fight. The protagonist's home village serves as a hub. It allows the player to explore the worlds in any order, as well as to buy and use upgrades. The village is also where the character respawns after dying. Upgrades Defeating powerful enemies grants the protagonist spare parts to upgrade itself. The player is free to customize his or her robot. Some additions improve the character's existing skills, while others give it new options, such as different types of attack. For example, the player can equip his or her robot with additional weapons, such as a gun or a hammer, or enhance its jumps with a rocket booster. The player can save and load the upgrade schemes."

home-2012,11069.0,"Home is a 2D pixel horror that offers a player to try on the role of a character who does not understand where he is and how he got there. The development of the game involved only one person - it's Benjamin River, and his take is similar to such games in the genre as Lone Survivor and Amnesia, only corrected for pixel graphics. The main decisions in the game are made using a simple binary system: you just have to answer the questions with Yes / No. Based on the answers, the plot of the game develops, which narrates the mysterious murder. There are several unexpected twists in the plot based solely on the player's choices. The game is very short and requires a lot of replays to fully understand its story - each time the player can experiment with the answers and get new answers from the game. However, you will not get all the answers - the game is not so elaborated. Home can create the right atmosphere, which, however, will not appeal to all fans of the genre: here you will have to read a lot and think through every answer."

hatoful-boyfriend,3253.0,"In Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings, the player enters the world of sentient birds to romance with them. Setting The game is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, where the human civilization was taken over by the birds. In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers. Plot The player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species. Gameplay Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game's world and plot. Endings The game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans."
binary-domain,3965.0,"Humanity has just solved problems like global warming - with the help of robots. Robot assistants were American, behaved correctly and differed from people clearly. But one madman from Tokyo began to produce robots that do not know that they are robots - and this can be understood because they look and behave exactly like people. This is a violation of the law, and the team of pros from different countries flies to Japan to forever stop the conveyor of the insane inventor. Robots with problems of self-identification can provide a variety for those fans of tactical shooters who are tired of terrorists and zombies. The game has visually attractive features. The style of opponents, the style of equipping the team of heroes are very attractive and original. Some details of the battles are well presented - bullets knock out picturesque clouds of debris. Locations are less expressive - apparently, so as not to interfere with focusing on the actual combat. A notable feature of the gameplay is the dependence of the relationship in the team on the player's actions. If the team has bad mutual support - lower trust, lower trust - lower effectiveness in combat."

f1-race-stars,4183.0,"F1 Race Stars is a parody of a Formula One simulation. It renders the F1 racers as wacky characters and their cars as karts. Style The game features drivers, teams, and races from the 2012 season of Formula One. However, unlike most simulators, which aim to represent the races realistically, F1 Race Stars is a humorous arcade game. The racers, such as Sebastian Vettel, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton, are depicted as cartoonish versions of themselves. Tracks There's a total of eleven tracks based on the real Formula One circuits. They retained their basic configurations but were enhanced with springboards, loops, traps, and other unrealistic features. The circuits' backgrounds also became comical representations of a country where the race is set in. Gameplay Although the game is a kart simulation, F1 Race Stars doesn't imitate the actual karting, either. It provides a fictional combination of karting and Formula driving experiences. The cars in the game cannot drift and slide. Instead, the game uses the real-world KERS system to give the car a boost when exiting the corner. The game features power-up in the vein of Super Mario Kart, and some of them are parodies of the actual Formula One elements, such as a safety car. Each team in F1 Race Stars also has a special ability, such as shooting at the opponents for Ferrari or a free boost for Red Bull."

lucius,17013.0,"06.06.1966 - an unusual number of sixes on this date, perhaps, somehow affected the character of one boy, born that day - Lucius. And certainly his character was influenced by the fact that his father is Lucifer himself, who on the sixth day after birth informed the boy that he had prepared many gifts for him. But to get these gifts, the boy needs a little work. Namely - to finish off everyone who lives with the boy in the same house or just inappropriately appeared next to him. This is a lot of people - twenty. Most different, from butlers and gardeners to reporters, priests and police. Papa Lucifer did not make any special demands, he was soft with his son - he did not order any special methods of murder, he agreed to any. But life is unpredictable, and the boy had to often retreat from simple scenarios, acting very ingeniously. On the other hand, he already had some of the unusual gifts - for example, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, the ability to subordinate someone else's will."

defenders-of-ardania,18283.0,"Defenders of Ardania (DoA) is a next-generation tower defense game set in the rich fantasy world of Majesty, but with a twist. Besides the addictive core mechanics of placing towers to stop advancing enemy units, DoA also allows players to take on the role of the attackers seeking to conquer the enemy base. DoA’s innovative new game concepts include light RTS elements, taking the popular genre to the next level. Players must oversee unit production and upgrades while assembling the most effective army from one of three playable races, each with unique locations, towers, and units. However, without magic, a fantasy game is little more than a toothless lion (or dragon, rather), so a wide range of spells will be available for players to decimate their enemies and protect their forces. Although DoA includes a single-player portion, the focus of the game is undoubtedly multiplayer, where two to four players can take each other on or compete against AI opponents via Internet, LAN, or PSN. The multiplayer component offers three different game modes where players can assume either the defensive or offensive sides – or both!

dmc-devil-may-cry,18241.0,"DMC: Devil May Cry is a hack-and-slash adventure game, the fifth installment in Capcom’s Devil May Cry franchise and reboot of the series. This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks. The gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features."

The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him. The task of the player is complicated by the fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships at the same time. This country fears a lot, seeks to control everything and periodically generates various rules. The game has a lot of humour, a lot of exciting puzzles and unexpected twists, including shooting.

starseed-pilgrim,19353.0,"The only driving force in this game is the curiosity of the player. Unusual game In the game there are no goals set explicitly and in advance, there are no videos telling anything, there are no monsters with which it is impossible not to fight. Nevertheless, something constantly happens in the game, and what happens in it causes both curiosity and consequences - especially, depending on what you do in the game. For a start, you can go through a very briefing and then step into the world of the game to explore everything by yourself. Unusual setting, unusual gameplay The character of the game is a small man, alone in the whole space of the game. He is surrounded by blocks of different colors. Blocks grow like trees or duckweed on the surface of water. They can even be planted with seeds, just like plants are planted. Each seed after planting in the ""soil"" germinates differently. As a result, you are always surrounded by growing “bushes” or “fields” of blocks that live their own and special lives. It seems that these seeds and blocks speak to you in their own language. Understanding this language and learning how to interact with “plants” is one of the tasks of the game and the condition for success in it. But all this time, another dimension of the game world is slowly destroying the very ground on which you stand. It destroys your world, because everything in it rests on this soil. Clear answers It is noteworthy that everything that happens in the game has its own logic and can ultimately be clarified definitively and definitely. But until that happens, the player may feel ignorant and even confused. Individuality The path to understanding all of this is individual for each player and to a significant degree it is the player who determines what this path will be. The player determines this by his actions, his manner of reacting to what is happening in the game. Goals and story The game still has some goals that the player must achieve. But even the discovery of these goals is based on the fact that the game causes the player curiosity and in the process of satisfying this curiosity the player comes to both understanding the goal and the decision whether to reach this goal or not. There is also a kind of plot, a story in the game. But this story is represented by fragments scattered throughout the game world. Music to relieve To relieve the tension that may arise from the difficulties of the game, music that accompanies the gameplay helps well."

Your goal is to move forward through the maze by solving many difficult and intricate puzzles.

The protagonist is armed with a variety of “guns”, each of them allows you to manipulate a certain set of objects in the maze. Antichamber is defined by its impossible, non-euclidian geometry that bends 3D space in the ways not found in the real world. All the regular laws of physic do not apply in this place that seems to be straight out of M. C. Escher's drawings. Doors can become portals leading to an unpredictable place, or even different places, depending on how you enter them. The visual style of Antichamber is very minimalistic. Walls, doors, and ladders are only outlined with sketch-like black contours, while any color serves to attract the player's attention to a certain object.

mechwarrior-online,11163.0,"MechWarrior Online™MechWarrior Online™ is a tactical, 'Mech-based online shooter set in the rich BattleTech Universe. The battlefields of the 31st century are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units known as BattleMechs. Piloting these war machines are the most elite soldiers that the galaxy has ever known. To most, they are known simply as MechWarriors. You will assume the role of an elite MechWarrior, fighting for supremacy over the galaxy against other players.Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.GameplayPiloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players."

the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot,41656.0,"The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is an MMO-only game. It offers the player to build a fantasy castle filled with traps and to raid the castles constructed by the other players. The game is full of puns and jokes about high fantasy tropes. The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot requires the constant internet connection. There are two main modes: assault and building. Castle building In this mode, the player builds a dangerous dungeon for other players to crawl. The builder can customize his or her castle, give it a name and enhance it with monsters, traps, bombs, and other defenses. More defense options can be unlocked as the player progresses. Every castle has a treasury room in its middle as a bait to give other players a reason to explore it. Castle assault In this mode, the player controls a character in a manner similar to Diablo or DotA games. The characters belong to four classes, each with its own comical personality: mage, archer, knight, or runaway. The player picks a castle and tries to fight his or her way through its traps and monsters. Each castle has a level that indicates its difficulty and the amount of reward. The goal is to reach the castle's treasury. By doing so, the player earns gold and other useful loot such as equipment that can be used in future raids. Shutdown The game's official online servers are discontinued since 2016. There's a mobile version of the game released in 2017, though it lacks the castle building element and uses pre-programmed levels."

The player takes control of the buggy and joins La Resistance to prevent the Count Soap crimes and the use of stolen water. The buggy can be customized to your taste, using more than 35 upgrades.

simcity,54172.0,"SimCity is an open-ended city-building video game series originally designed by Will Wright. The first game in the series, SimCity, was published by Maxis in 1989. The success of SimCity sparked the creation of several sequels and many other spin-off ""Sim"" titles, including 2000's The Sims, which itself became a best-selling computer game and franchise. In the SimCity games, the player develops a city from a patch of undeveloped land. The player controls where to place development zones, infrastructure like roads and power plants, landmarks, and public services such as schools, parks, hospitals and fire stations. The player also determines the tax rate, the budget, and social policy. The city is populated by ""Sims"", simulated persons, who live in the city created by the player. The three development zone types are the major areas in which Sims inhabit: residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones where Sims find work in factories, laboratories and farms. While there is no particular win condition in a game of SimCity, the balancing act of the above mentioned factors provide the constraints which make gameplay possible. To maximize population or profitability, to re-create real life locations in-game, achieve an aesthetic design or to trigger as many natural disasters as possible are among the many possible goals one can determine for oneself while playing a SimCity game. The SimCity universe is loosely based on 20th century California urbanization, and all editions have some common thematic elements: in a new game players start from an undeveloped greenfield, cars are the default form of transportation, and earthquakes happen."

warface,28859.0,"This is a free-to-play online first-person shooter, from Crytek and publisher My.com, a subsidiary of Russian Mail.ru Group, focused on the western market.

planetary-annihilation,16014.0,"Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game's engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command & Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game. The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and ""planet thrusters""; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one's operations across different systems at the later stages of the game."

bientot-lete,19684.0,"Bientôt l’été is a videogame for two players. Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras. The empty beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused. Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness. When it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic networks, they touch each other’s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman, can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been to lovers everywhere. The sea remains, tugging at their hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary. Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting. Enter a café, exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion. We know this is not real. So it doesn’t surprise us. Nothing surprises us. It doesn’t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love, of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time. There is only love. And it never stops. No matter how much it hurts."

betrayer,17794.0,"Betrayer is a first-person horror game developed by Blackpowder Games. Plot The game is set in the 17th-century state of Virginia. The protagonist awakes on a shore with no memory of the events leading him here. He goes to Fort Henry which appears to be completely abandoned. The whole colony is actually abandoned, yet there are hostile beings whose bodies consist of burning embers. The protagonist goes on to seek answers about what actually happened in the colony. Gameplay Betrayer heavily relies on stealth in its gameplay. There are no clear paths or objective for the players to follow. This was made specifically to deprive the players of any sense of direction and encourage exploration of a monochrome game world. It is essential to listen to specific sounds in the game, as some of them will guide the players towards a clue or an important item. The clues are documented and put in your inventory upon picking them up. Upon encountering the enemies, the best strategy for the player is to hide in the high grass, spectate the enemy movement and pick the right moment to execute a stealth kill. Sound plays an important role here too, as any sound the players make in the grass will attract some unwanted attention, so it is essential to time your movement with the wind gusts. The players have access to a wide variety of weapons, such as pistols, muskets, tomahawks, and bows. Upon death, the players leave all their items at the place of death and can retrieve them."

With experience comes skill. If the experience is not enough, you can always recruit more, having passed any level repeatedly."

signal-ops,19668.0,"Greetings Officer-Cadet o249,Are you ready to be put to the test? If deemed worthy, you will be assigned as an officer in the shadowy halls of Facility 7C. You will remotely lead a squad of operatives on daring espionage missions to plant evidence, steal secrets, assassinate targets, and perform sabotage for the glory of the Dark Father. Do you have enough faith to follow orders unquestioningly?Yours truly in darkness, Signal Ops is a played in a first-person perspective, but when you're playing a mission you actually simultaneously control multiple agents, each with their own first-person view. You'll need to take advantage of the multiple views to keep an eye on key areas, formulate strategies to complete your goals, and solve puzzles that require you to be in more than one place at a time.

For example: you will often need to use your map to plan your moves in open levels, and health does not magically regenerate. Don't worry though, agents are a dime a dozen. As long as you still have an agent alive, you can call in reinforcements to replace those unlucky ones that had too much lead for breakfast.The radio is where the signal in Signal Ops comes from.

The action takes place immediately after the end of the original game: the main characters assumed that they escaped danger, but fate decreed otherwise and they find themselves on a ship full of zombies.

knock-knock,2774.0,"Knock-Knock is a survival horror game developed by Russian studio Ice-Pick Lodge on Unity. The main difference from most horror games is that the fear factor itself is achieved by using the environment. Sounds, creepy texts, suspense - all of that affects the players. Plot The game's plot is full of unclear moments and allows for multiple interpretations. There is a house in a middle of the forest. It has been used as a lab and a home for three generations of its residents. The Last Resident, just like his ancestors, studies the world around him. One day, the Resident notices that his environment weirdly changes - sounds appear here and there, items get missing. The Resident wants to figure out what's going on. Gameplay The main objective of the game is to help the Resident survive in his house until dawn. This can be achieved by walking around the house and turning the light on in its rooms. Only if the player turns on the light in the room, it becomes possible to interact with the items placed inside that room. Such items are the clock, that can be used to speed up time, or hiding spots. Lighting is an indicator for the appearance of your enemies as it turns off when someone is close to the player. The gameplay is affected by the Resident's bad memory and eyesight. The time in the game is relative. It can pause, pass as usual, or go back. This depends on the player's actions."
guardians-of-middle-earth,17507.0,"If DotA was set in John R. R. Tolkien's fantasy universe, it would have been Guardians of Middle-Earth. This multiplayer-oriented game unites players in teams of up to five to battle against each other on an arena, or to fight an AI-controlled team of the same size. The game offers more than 30 playable characters, mostly from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, including Bilbo, Sauron, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gollum. Their design is based on Peter Jackson's movie series. There are also several characters that don't appear directly in movies or books, such as Arathorn, father of Aragorn. All characters are divided into ""good"" and ""evil"" factions to preserve a semblance of continuity behind the battles, so that Kili wouldn't have to fight Thorin, for example. Treacherous Saruman can join either side. The goal of each team is to destroy the enemy base that is protected not only by the opposing players but also by defense towers. Gameplay in Guardians of Middle-Earth has a distinct ""RTS"" feel to it. Both teams’ bases regularly spawn “minions” who join players in the fight, making the game more about clashes of armies than duels between individual champions. The RPG element is minimal, and there are no in-game items or upgrades."

deadfall-adventures,10376.0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe!The StoryThe year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten...Key FeaturesAction -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes"
sniper-ghost-warrior-2,17600.0,"A sequel to Sniper: Ghost Warrior is based on CryEngine 3 and is somewhat similar to such tactical shooters as Crysis. Plot The protagonist is Cole Anderson, a gruff American ex-Marine, who accompanies a CIA agent on a mission. Their goal is to capture a group of mercenaries who are trying to obtain a biological weapon of mass destruction. The villain, former Russian spy Merinov, is going to sell the weapon to a terrorist organization that plans to provoke a nuclear war. The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines’ jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson’s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov. Gameplay Just like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet’s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There’s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character’s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay. Anderson has to sneak past enemy soldiers and cannot survive an open encounter against multiple opponents."

takedown-red-sabre,19686.0,"TAKEDOWN is a thinking-person’s shooter; brutal, hardcore and deadly - like the real thing. Not for the faint hearted, Takedown requires you to bring your 'A' game - FPS fans looking for an ultra hardcore experience only need apply!The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability.In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and “cinematic experiences.” The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.This game focuses on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your environment, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You won’t be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don’t expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you – it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand. With features such as realistic bullet penetration, accuracy, and recoil, choosing the proper weapons, ammunition, armor, and gear for the mission is up to you, so choose carefully.Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer. If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the game for you.Key Features:Fight Smart in Deadly, Close Quarters Combat – Players must think and move tactically, stay alert, watch, listen and choose wisely while setting up their squad for the perfect shot.

dark-souls-ii,3751.0,"Dark Souls II is the third installment in the well-known Souls series. It’s a different game from all the others because of its directors. With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. Dark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised. Yet the game is interesting and deep and it’s definitely a must play for every Souls fan."

ultimate-general-gettysburg,3087.0,"Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a Tactical Battle Simulator that allows you to lead thousands of soldiers in the famous Battle of Gettysburg as commander of either the Union or Confederate army. The game features the most accurately created map, complex morale, innovative control mechanics and smart AI. You have the freedom to use different strategies while the battle progresses. Your decisions and military performance play a crucial role in the result. Lead your army and win the Battle of Gettysburg! It has been voted as Best Strategy Game of 2014 by PCGamesN.Main Features Smart AI Commanders Ultimate General: Gettysburg does not use “AI gameplay cheats” because it does not need them. The game’s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills. AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players. Each one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends. The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality. For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battles.What players say: “Fantastic AI - don't know what kind of brain you put in this game but it works”Multi-Day Dynamic Battle On the morning of July 1st 1863, the two armies meet near Gettysburg. Reinforcements arrive from historically accurate directions as the battle progresses, however, random events, delays and tactical differences are always a possibility that can change the results of each engagement compared to history.Can you re-enact Pickett’s Charge? What if Lee attacked the center of the Union Army early in the morning of July 2nd of 1863 instead of attempting to flank the extreme left in the afternoon? What would happen if Meade counter-attacked on July 4th 1863? These questions and more can be answered within the game engine of Ultimate General: Gettysburg.The battle is dynamically fought in time phases and can last up to 4 days. Each day can be separated by up to 3 time phases and the armies’ condition and positioning on the map are saved.According to battle events, you have the possibility to take decisions that can change the tide of the battle based on your prior tactical prowess. For example, when leading the Confederates, on the morning of July 2nd, you can choose to attack at Cemetery Hill and not make a delayed flanking maneuver at Peach Orchard… if you have managed to take Seminary Ridge the previous day! You can even choose to defend and wait for your AI opponent to take the initiative between days. These choices greatly increase the number of possible battle outcomes and challenges.What players say:“9 different AI profiles, multiple outcomes, multiple strategies, casualties carry over. This game is a different experience every time. Well worth it, can't wait for the next one.”Easy Controls & Unit Self-Awareness Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces easily. Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input. Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for “babysitting”. What players say: “Innovative movement system - this is by far an awesome system they developed. It’s not only insanely easy to learn, but also incredibly innovative”Detailed Map of Gettysburg Utilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game. What players say: “Incredible Gorgeous Map - I had to capitalize that because this map is by far one of the best maps of Gettysburg I have ever seen either in a game or even in books”Advanced Line of SightElevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically. Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same to you. The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly. What players say: “The way Game Labs implemented Line of Sight in this game should be held as an example to other developers to do the same”Numerous Tactical Factors In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay. Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue. What players say: “... positioning of units matters. You really bring the struggles of 19th century warfare to life here”Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders Ultimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in between.All brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts. Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated. Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress. What players say: “Immersive American Civil War feel: sounds, portraits and general historical authentic really make this one of the most immersive historical games I have played, and I am a total history buff”Furthermore, every inch of the map has a strategic role. Sloping, terrain type and obstructions affect unit movement realistically. Elevations, ridges and hills provide excellent firing positions and give increased sight, morale and accuracy to troops stationed there.By placing your units close to each other, they become more resilient to charges and flank attacks but get more vulnerable to projectile fire. Thus, forcing your enemy to keep his lines dense while you shell him with artillery can be a valid tactic. As the condition of your units changes dynamically during the battle, the effectiveness of your whole army is affected. For example, units fire more coordinated volleys when they have high morale and have more discipline and tight formations.These and many more deep gameplay mechanics are packed into a simple and intuitive GUI that aims to ease the game experience for the player without overwhelming with complex statistics.Evolving Multiplayer ExperienceThe game currently offers 18 maps for 1vs1 matches and is continuously improved according to user feedback. What players say: “Well, actually, the AI in this game is about the best ever seen (except for chess), and there is a working multiplayer with about always at least one battle going.”Ultimate General: Gettysburg is developed by Game Labs and designed by Nick Thomadis, known for his successful and popular “DarthMod” series.How to Play Please read our guide"

this-war-of-mine,1090.0,"A small town surrounded by war. The usual order is irrevocably violated, you have to survive, but you are not a soldier and certainly not a superhero. The player controls a group of two to four civilians selected from twelve characters. The goal is simple - to survive the war. Later, new people can join the group. Characters need food, can get sick, freeze, die from wounds. Can run away with all the food stock. The day is different from the night in everything. During the day we equip the shelter, repair and produce weapons and tools - from what can be found. In the afternoon we communicate with neighbours, sometimes with benefit. At night we go out for prey. The night harbours us but also harbours looters, often they are armed. Winter brings cold and freezes water, requires more health and firewood. Decisions that have to be made often have a moral dimension - can one rob an unarmed person if this is a matter of life and death for someone from the group? As in life, events are seen as random and do not repeat from game to game. The same characters can behave very differently, and the siege can sometimes last twenty days, and sometimes eighty."

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know).

'Crimes and Punishments' is six out of seven games in the series. Gameplay The player takes a role of Sherlock Holmes — famous detective. The game consists of 6 non-related cases. The first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. Story Three out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. Features One of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant. The loading screen as it appears rarely provides one with not only the loading bar but also the evidence to inspect and clues to examine thus using the loading time fully."

abyss-odyssey,3642.0,"Abyss Odyssey is an action platformer game developed by the ACE Team. The game also features several roguelike elements. Plot The game follows several heroes that descend into the dungeons of a 19th century Chile city of Santiago to find a warlock, whose dreams wreck havoc on the streets of a South American town. Gameplay In its gameplay, Abyss Odyssey fuses several genres into one, creating something absolutely new. The players control a character, whose main objective is to complete procedurally generated levels without dying and killing as many monsters as they can on the way to the exit from the level. The implementation of procedural generation results in a high degree of replayability as no level will play out the same. Due to the infusion of roguelike elements to the game, the players only have one life. Upon death, the players are given a weaker character to play as. This new character sets out to avenge the death of a previous one. It is possible to revive your dead character by finding them and using a special alter that has to be found somewhere on the level. The game's combat is heavily inspired by several Japanese fighting games. The players are awarded new loot upon timing their moves correctly. Abyss Odyssey features a unique level unlock system, that is driven by the community. On the game's release, only the first act was available for playing. The next ones were unlocked upon a certain number of players beating the game's bosses."

magicka-wizard-wars,42145.0,"Magicka: Wizard Wars was a MOBA game set in the world of the Magicka franchise. While its core gameplay was 4v4 battles, the game had a heavy focus on the sandbox aspect. The game had no single campaign and was free-to-play. Servers were shut down in 2016 due to the lack of audience. During arena battles, players controlled wizards who used elements to create spells. There were eight elements tied to keyboard buttons; every combination of three elements gave a certain effect on the wizard himself, his teammates or enemies. As the amount of combination was huge, their usage was limited only by players’ imagination. This mechanics was, in fact, a slightly reduced version from Magicka. As every element has an opposite one that counterattacks the spell, battles were based on the reaction rate of players. There were three modes: a classic three-lane map with mobs and bases, a team deathmatch, and a 1v1 duel."

Although the ammunition is hard to find in the game, players have access to a wide variety of firearms which include but are not limited to a revolver, shotgun, and a sniper rifle."
tesla-effect-a-tex-murphy-adventure,19530.0,"Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is a detective game with a high amount of attention given to plot unraveling. It is the 6th game in the corresponding series: with the five titles preceding it and one succeeding in late 2018. The game very much resembles the tradition of point-and-click adventures. One of the core narrative features is a 3D realistic background and live captured videos instead of usual cutscenes. All of the games within a series feature the self-titled protagonist with a setting in 2050. Tesla Effect uncovers the story of a Chelsee Bando disappearance. The first part of the title cues the players into realizing the role of Nicola Tesla in the narrative. It is little to invent in the point-and-click genre, but the development of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is presumably cut into two parts: actual cutscene and backgrounds filming and composing it all into the game content. The game features 5 endings and branching paths within the characters' arcs. The choices within those arcs influence the ending outcome."

The players have to deliver cargo using the post-Soviet machinery deep in the Russian woods, where there are no solid roads and a lot of fallen trees. The main feature of the game is dynamic terrain. That is achieved with Havok physics engine. Trucks leave marks on the road, get stuck in the terrain, which makes the further advancement harder. Thanks to Havok, the terrain is procedurally generated every time the player loads a map. That adds a high replayability value to the game. This feature also makes the races against other players much harder, as you can't just win a race by going as fast as you can. In SPINTIRES, the game focuses a lot on simulating the physics and behavior of the vehicles. Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car. The players can also modify the cars using different attachments. It is possible to attach fuel tanks, repair kits, and so on. Multiplayer The game features a 4-player multiplayer mode, where the players can choose the time of day, and the environment.

consortium,17066.0,"The Consortium is the first person shooter RPG, which takes place on the futuristic ship Zenlil. The period for the world of the game is the middle of the 21st century, the time in which all the armed forces were dissolved, and the law-enforcement function was assigned to the police under the name Consortium. The hierarchy on the ship is similar to chess. The player takes control over one of the crew members - Bishop 6, an elite soldier. This is the first part of the trilogy. The structure of the plot of the game is often compared with Mass Effect Trilogy - because of the story branches, each playthrough differs from the previous one. A detailed background - the developers claim about 150 000 words in the script - only enhances the effect. Also note the unusual implementation of the dialogue tree: the developers sought to recreate lifelike conversations, each response changes the attitude of the NPCs to the main character. In total, more than 20 characters are available for communication, and the soundtrack of the game was written by the famous composer Jeremy Soule, who worked on such games as The Elder Scrolls V, Company of Heroes and Guild Wars."

gods-will-be-watching,7442.0,"Gods Will Be Watching is a point-and-click survival thriller. Deconstructeam have developed it, and it is the only title within the IP. The game was incipiently created within the Ludum Dare development competition, the theme of which was minimalism. That gradually affected the style of a final game build. The story centers around the group of survivors questioned with a quest to survive during the 40 days being cut off from the outside world. The game's core feature is the variety of moral decision — the player decides who is worthy of sacrificing for the sake of the group's survival. The gameplay features walking and talking with the other characters — six in total — while a heavy accent is made on time- and resource management. The game's name derives from the absence of right and wrong decisions: not only the survival of the team is a task at hand but the survival of an outside world from genocide."

sir-you-are-being-hunted,19594.0,"Known also under the alternative name “Madam, you are being hunted”, the game is a mixture of survival horror and the open world exploration. The game has a singleplayer mode, where players alone try to escape from the robots and do the same together with friends in the multiplayer mode. All actions are performed from the first person perspective. Players need to escape from Hunters, robots dressed like victorian-age gentlemen and their assistants: robodogs or worse. Robots must find and kill all players to get out of the island on which the action of the game unfolds. The landscape of the island is different during each playthrough - procedurally generated mechanics help to do so: the game engine chooses from five main themes - from the countryside to industrial areas. Players need to look for food and weapons to survive, besides, to spare parts for transport. The latter serves as the only way out of the island. Most of the game process is within the genre of stealth, so do not expect dazzling action from this game."

the-old-city-leviathan,19532.0,"The Old City: Leviathan is an experiment in first person exploration that focuses entirely on story.Everything else is secondary. All that exists is you and the world. Set in a decaying city from a civilization long past, The Old City: Leviathan puts the player in the shoes of a sewer dwelling isolationist. You progress through the narrative by simply exploring the world. The story itself is told via the musings of your character and, chiefly, the environment itself. This environment has been designed to be diverse, interesting, and meaningful to the narrative of the game.The objective is to understand. The story of The Old City: Leviathan is not told in a traditional manner. As you progress through the narrative, you will overhear a conversation between two entities. The first entity is the nameless character you are controlling who communicates through a monologue. The second entity is the depths of the environment, details and all. Your task is to piece together the narrative as if you are jumping into a conversation with no context. The more you explore, the more you will potentially understand.This experience is not a normal one."

The real story is that Continue? is an existential metaphor that explores the finite nature of existence and the beauty and tyranny of our desires within it.From the developer:For fans of cerebral games such as Gone Home, The Novelist, and Papers Please.This is one of those love it or hate it experimental art games. Regardless of whether you like it or not, I ensure you that it is like nothing you've ever played before. It's less about action and strategy and more about taking an emotional and philosophical journey that allows the player to explore his or her own sense of mortality. You will be very, very confused along the way, but your interpretation of this confusion is what the game is all about. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not looking for something very weird and different. Continue? is for the type of person that appreciates odd, poetic word play, interpretation of the abstract, and existential philosophy.Some games we play to kill time on a long commute, some we play at home to blow off steam after a hard day’s work, and some games are about escaping into a world more magical than our own. Continue? is meant to be played late at night with some wine or weed, when you're feeling quiet and contemplative.Everything in Continue? has a deeper meaning behind it. All of the strange places you go to, people you talk to, and scenarios you go through are part of a greater idea that I hope you spend a second or two trying to figure out and interpret...or not. You can also just play the damn thing.What happens to dead video game characters?In the garbage dump of the Random Access Memory, you travel from town to town, meeting people who offer you their lightning and their prayer. Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which affects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.Each game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.DevelopmentContinue? was inspired by existential road trips into nowhere, Peruvian jungle drugs, and a brush with death while lost in the mountains of New Mexico.

ryse-son-of-rome,17803.0,"The action of Ryse: Son of Rome is set in the capital of the Roman Empire, which is besieged by the Celtic barbarians led by Boudica. Emperor Nero says from the balcony of the Palace that the defenders of the city should protect him. Marius, the General of Rome (you will play for him) and the commander of the defenders, gives a small sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it, saying this is the key to victory. Then he secures the ruler in the secret room and begins his story. The player will have to fight a lot with the enemies. There is a weak attack, there are quick sword strikes, allowing to deprive the enemy off balance, as well as a potent offence, for which you need to hold the button for a few seconds. It is better to attack at the right moments: striking, dodging and parrying, you can bring the combo counter to indecently high numbers. There is also a system of finishing the enemy, which can finally overthrow the opponent.

It is the direct continuation of Batman: Arkham Origins and is a canon installment of the Batman: Arkham series. Plot Three months after his first encounter with Joker, Bruce Wayne comes across the Catwoman who stole documents from a secret government organization. She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison's staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages. Gameplay Unlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania.

The Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman's Detective Vision. When Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him.

murdered-soul-suspect,3427.0,"The hero is a policeman, talented and devoted to duty. But there is a clarification - this is a dead policeman, killed because of his work, but he did not leave the world, he turned into a ghost and did not lose his passion for investigations. A hero can do many things in our world, but not all. Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses, only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see, read, think. But he can not take and move things, cannot talk with living people - for actions with objects and communication he has to find a girl-medium. In the game, you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this. Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example, a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts, who were once people and killed - after talking with them, you can learn about the circumstances of this. Finding evidence and reasoning is not the only thing that you have to do. The hero can be killed a second time, and it will be definitive - some disembodied beings seek to destroy the hero's soul. But they are vulnerable, and the hero can kill them."

the-castle-doctrine,19680.0,"The Castle Doctrine is a massively-multiplayer game of burglary and home defense. It's 1991, and things are bad. You're a guy with a house and family. Other players are coming to take what's yours. Build security to stop them. Study their houses, buy tools, and break in to take what's theirs. Everything you do is permanent.I'm Jason Rohrer, and The Castle Doctrine is my 10th game. It's a bit hard to describe, because there's never been anything quite like it before. It's a brutal game in terms of its perma-death and perma-destruction consequences, and it is turn-based, so it's rather Rogue-like. But building such a brutal game in a multiplayer context, with absolutely no cushion between players to stop them from brutalizing each other, is quite strange and new. Everything is real in this game. When you rob someone, you are actually hurting another player in a permanent way by destroying and stealing their hard work. When someone dies in this game, they lose everything and start over. If you devise perplexing security systems, you can perma-death other players when they come to rob you. Watching those security tapes, where someone gets what's coming to them, is an exhilarating experience. On the other hand, you just killed someone and perhaps caused them to lose days of their hard work. And you've been on the other side too, losing everything because of some thoughtless move you made in someone else's house.But there is no randomness in this game, so everything is fair. When you die, it is always your fault. When things get dicey, you can always retreat back out the front door to save your own neck. Of course, human folly will get the better of you.Here's what you get when you buy the game:A lifetime account on the central world server that I'm running.Access to the full game source code (after launching the game on Steam, go here).Everything you need to run your own game server (requires a PHP/MySQL web server, download the source bundle to get started)."
1954-alcatraz,16710.0,"1954: Alcatraz – The cash is out there. But who will get it? Joe's doing 40 years on Alcatraz for a heist on an armored truck. The loot is still hidden out there, but only Joe knows where it is. In the streets of San Francisco, Joe's ex-accomplices and his wife are eager to find the stolen money. Who will get their hands on the dough? In this interactive Point & Click adventure by Daedalic Entertainment and Irresponsible Games - the team of Gene Mocsy - Joe and his wife Christine will be playable characters. Players will decide between love, treachery, life and death: will Christine assist Joe during his prison break? Will they recover the fortune together? Or will they succumb to greed? Will Christine deceive her husband, taking revenge for all the disappointments and a marriage that brought her nothing but hardship? Will she just turn her back on Joe and hit the road with his former accomplices? Or will Joe gain everything in the end? 1954: Alcatraz offers all what makes a great adventure: challenging puzzles, a mature crime story with a dynamic plot and various possible outcomes, and a whole bunch of shady characters: brutal felons, making life on The Rock even harder for Joe, while outside not only his partners-in-crime but also snoops and cops are after the money and Christine. The cinematic San Francisco of the 1950s, caught in a gritty comic style is a harsh place. But it's also a place where 1954: Alcatraz can also pay homage to history and zeitgeist, in form of the Beatnik culture and other contemporary themes. .Key FeaturesTwo playable characters: the gangster couple Joe and Christine More than 20 additional 3D animated characters More than 60 hand drawn backdrops, based on original footage of San Francisco, North Beach and Alcatraz Challenging puzzles and exciting dialogues by Gene Mocsy, co-writer of Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island Atmospheric Beat and Jazz soundtrack by Pedro Macedo Camacho (Fairytale Fights, Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island, A Vampyre Story, Audiosurf) In-game decisions extensively influence the plot and lead to various endings"

castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2,3759.0,"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure and a straight continuation of the first part of the franchise. It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors. Gameplay The game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies. Story The game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures. DLC The Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: ""Dark Dracula"" and ""Armored Dracula"" bring only new characters skins and sprites."
sacred-3,3628.0,"Sacred 3 is a hack’n’slash game, a third installment in the series. Plot The game starts with a brief introduction to the fantasy world of Ancaria. The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world. Gameplay The third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level. Graphics and other features The game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses. The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies."

back-to-bed,7353.0,Back to bed is an indie surreal puzzle game developed by Bedtime Digital Games. The game was initially developed as a student project for DADIU. The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter. The player's objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player. The game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There's also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker's outfit or simply the typography of the game.

infinity-runner,1620.0,"The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind; flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars. However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 & DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player. In Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. Even though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship. The Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. There is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre! FEATURES * WEREWOLVES IN SPACE! * 14 ACTION PACKED LEVELS * ARCADE MODE * STORY-MODE * OCULUS RIFT MODE (DK1 - DK2 Runtime 4.4) * WOLF LEVELLING SYSTEM * MULTI-PLAYER MODE WITH UP TO 32 PLAYERS STARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION Over 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown."

You are Caroline, you live her day, and you have to make some big decisions which will change the outcome of the game - 4PM will try to create an interesting blend between linear, cinematic stories and interactive gameplayNote:This is not a typical, mechanics driven game, it is a short, interactive story with gameplay elements. If you are interested in something a bit different, experimental, then this is it, if you are looking for an open world, leveling up, puzzles and 10 hours of gameplay then this is probably not for you.

soma,3168.0,"SOMA is a sci-fi survival horror that makes you rethink the description of death. You play as Simon Jarrett who was injured in a crash accident and agreed for an experimental operation on his brain. He wakes up at an abandoned underwater facility full of mutants. Trying to figure out what’s going on, Simon finds Catherine Chun, a scientist, who tells him about the technology of copying the human personality. The gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There's no combat, and you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles. Though there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers. Moral choices you have to make don’t affect the story much: instead, they change your attitude to the events, so it’s you who develops through the game."

the-age-of-decadence,10516.0,"The Age of Decadence, our first but hopefully not the last RPG, is now available. If you've been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you've just discovered it, ""stay awhile and listen"". The most commonly asked question is:What Kind of Game Is It?It’s a very different game than anything you’ve ever played. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn’t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn’t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path – Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass – such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule. The Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn’t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won’t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design. So What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games?1. The SetupTraditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three's game critic):""But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That’s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended.""The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain.You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats.2. Combat difficultyAnother design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It’s a hard game. Combat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can’t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights.You aren’t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we’re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you’re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you’ll end up dead before you can blink.3. Choices & ConsequencesChoices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you'll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable.Starting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin.The questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default. You will have to play the game several times to better understand what’s going on, piece everything together, and see the full effect of the choices you make.The Big Question: Should You Buy The Game?Try before you buy. Even if everything I said sounds exactly like your kind of game, try the demo first. That’s what it’s there for. It gives you access to the first Chapter, consisting of 3 locations and about 30 quests split between mutually exclusive questlines and decisions."

lovers-in-a-dangerous-spacetime,2822.0,"In Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, the player assumes control over the crew of a pixelated spaceship. Your goal is to navigate it through the dangerous 2D space, avoid asteroids and fight off enemy ships and space monsters. Every time the ship hits an object, it loses some of its health. The spaceship contains several devices, such as thrusters, laser cannons, and deflector shields, and one character can only control one device at a time. To keep the ship running and safe, the protagonists have to constantly move around the ship to activate a certain device. This is why, although Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can also be played alone, the game is strongly oriented towards the cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can participate and form a crew to thoroughly control every device. Even in the single-player mode, there’s the second protagonist, presumably your character's lover, who is controlled by the AI and obeys your orders. Pink-colored surfaces, gigantic hearts that need to be unchained, and other visual elements highlight the game’s underlying theme of love as the means to survive. The game’s visuals are colorful, albeit simple, and are based on the “superflat” art style."

The main producer of the robots is a corporation called Parallax, and it plans to create a new kind of fully independent AI. There's a rebel party called Human Revolution that aims to stop the progress of the AI. Plot The main engineer of Parallax, Hayden Webber, recently was abducted. The main protagonist is a journalist who researches the Webber's disappearance. He or she is accompanied by Turing, a highly advanced robotic assistant. They go on a search in the fictional city of Neo-San Francisco on the eve of Christmas. Gameplay 2064: Read Only Memories works as a point-and-click adventure game with a static first-person view. The environment and characters are presented to the player as slightly animated images. He or she can interact with them by clicking and choosing options, such as to look at, to take, or to speak to.

warhammer-end-times---vermintide,1225.0,"This multiplayer-only game based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy franchise is set in the End Time era of this setting. The plot is centered around the city of Ubersreik that was recently taken over by a horde of rat-like monsters called Skavens. The players, who can team up in groups of up to four, are tasked with cleaning the streets from the dirty invaders. There are thirteen levels with different objectives, some of which involve collecting certain items or protecting a city well from being poisoned. The gameplay is strongly reminiscent of that in Left 4 Dead series, in which the protagonists have to slaughter monsters coming in large numbers, using both melee and ranged weapons. There are five character classes, each with its unique specialization: the Dwarf Ranger and the Empire Soldier are strong and slow, the Witch Hunter and the Waywatcher are the fast scouts, and the Bright Wizard uses magic. On the levels, the players can find item perks that either restore health or ammo or buff the character. It is essential to fairly distribute the perks across the party, especially since every player can only have one perk in each category at a time."
else-heartbreak(),19666.0,"The world of this game consists not of atoms, but of bits of information - its reality is homogeneous with the reality of what is happening inside the computer. On the one hand, this is unusual - but on the other, it makes it possible to create anything if you become a programmer. You do not need to become a programmer to play this game - the world consisting of bits, this is only part of the plot of the game. And the game itself is intended for everyone, including those who do not have programming skills at all. A boring character in a boring city The character controlled by the player is called Sebastian. He arrives in the city of Dorisburg. He was offered a job there - not a programmer, but only a seller at Wellspring. The city is unfamiliar to Sebastian, he has no acquaintances there. Sebastian (that is, you as a player), until there is nothing left but to wander, explore the city, study duties at work and live quite ordinary life, go to a bar in the evenings, attend parties, make friends and hardly wake up to walk to work. Knock, knock, Sebastian Events get a significant acceleration when Sebastian meets a girl named Pixie. The main story of the game begins with this acquaintance. By the way, both the tempo of the story and its specific turns depend on what you decide (along with Sebastian). Everything can be stretched in time or, on the contrary, it can be carried at full speed, and where it goes - there is more than one option. Pixie girl tells (and shows) Sebastian that their world is a world controlled by coding and programming. True, not everyone knows this, and all the more, not everyone is allowed to use this knowledge for actions on their own. But where there are programmers, there are hackers. Moreover, the temptation is so great - to turn a trolley bus into a personal supercar, for example. How to say it in Sprak Sebastian acquires a gadget called modifyer - it shows the code of any object in the game. The codes are written in the Sprak language, which is very similar to Basic. The ease of transforming the world encourages Sebastian to try more and more different things. Errors are inevitable on this path - and it is difficult not to notice them, because try not to notice how you incorrectly programmed the skyscraper! By the way, the Sprak language is in itself a source of pleasant puzzles, having more than one solution for each puzzle. And the matter is not so much in the capabilities of the language, as in your capabilities - after all, you can find a variety of solutions for the same problem. For example, instead of “writing” a high-speed car for yourself, you can “write” a passage to the right place - even if it is separated from your “reality” for many kilometers. Big Play However, the game is not about harmless entertainment - a group of hackers who are at war with the government agency Ministry comes in contact with Sebastian. The government, of course, does not like it when everyone changes everything at will, and hackers resist control."

jotun,15274.0,"The graphics solution of the game may seem simple at first glance, but in fact, it is very addictive and elaborated with the exceptional talent of the artist. Reminds the best samples from the history of world animation. There is an impression that the directors and operators of the highest Hollywood level worked on all the scenes in the game - the hero's simple passage through the hanging ladder suddenly turns into an exciting panorama that you want to admire for a long time. Voices speaking the ancient Scandinavian languages, and beautiful original music help to create a tangible atmosphere of Nordic folklore and adventure. These advantages draw attention to the game, despite the lack of continuous action. There is no such action in the game, but when it does happen, its epic nature is suited to the world of Nordic fairy tales. Plots of these tales and a description of the world of Nordic myths are adequately represented in the game, it is even possible to study this topic. The gameplay consists of exploring large levels, searching for runes to enter the next level, avoiding various exotic troubles and rare but epic and picturesque battles."

Premise The main character is an office clerk who works in a storage department. His career lasts 40 years, each of them corresponding to an in-game puzzle. Two conveyor belts in the protagonist's office work as the input and the output devices, respectively. The input conveyor brings in the numbers and letters in the form of boxes. The protagonist is instructed to perform certain tasks and calculations with the boxes before sending them back through the output conveyor. The tasks usually require simple mathematical actions such as sorting and addition. The boxes remain stored on the office floor until the task is completed. Gameplay The player controls the character using commands that remind the assembly language. The handwritten notes represent the instructions the player gives to the character. As the player progresses through the puzzles, the game introduces more complicated concepts and mechanics, such as memory addresses. This feature allows the player to order the character to perform operations in the certain place of the office. The goal of each level is to create a program.

hand-of-fate,1545.0,"Hand of Fate is an unusual combination of various genres. It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. You play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way. Most of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay."

Gameplay The players are free to choose any faction to play as both in singleplayer campaign and multiplayer PvP mode. Each faction has its own set of units, buildings and drastically differs in gameplay from every other one. For example, Betas rely on speed and mobility to outmaneuver their enemies, while humans can use teleportation devices to deploy their forces to the battlefield quickly and reconstruct their own base in a matter of seconds. The game's developers put a heavy emphasis on the preference of macro decisions instead of micromanagement. This being said, the player's strategy serves as a deciding factor in winning the game, not the speed with which they buy their units and build structures."

pathologic-classic-hd,18708.0,"The original Indie Cult Classic returns fully restored, and more evocative than ever. Pathologic Classic HD is the Definitive Edition of the original Cult Classic Psychological First-Person Survival game. The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past. On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three ""heroes."" Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town. Brand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it. Brand New Voice-overs. New content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restored Updated textures and higher resolutions support.

Time is running, and mostly it’s running out; numerous events unfold, whether you’re there to witness them or not. 70+ hours of real-time gameplay without grinding or repetitive quests. As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events. 3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelor’s, the Haruspex’s, and the Changeling’s plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots. The plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. It’s not just about the fate of the dying town—it’s about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are. An open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story. Survival is tough. The dying town demands that you constantly keep an eye on your status, maintaining a full belly and decent immunity. That will require tough choices. Communicate, barter, rob, or steal. There are many ways to acquire your bare necessities, each of them with its own benefits and drawbacks. The atmosphere of bleakness and despair without cartoonish evil or bad guys.

the-fall-of-the-dungeon-guardians,11404.0,"Introduction :The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an RPG Dungeon Crawler game, in First Person View, inspired by classics like Dungeon Master™ and Might & Magic®, but featuring a modern tactical combat based on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism coupled with the threat & aggro system and an active pause. Story :You’re a newly employed guard of a prison deep inside a dungeon. The night of your arrival, strange things happen and when you wake up in the morning, all prisoners have escaped amidst chaos. The warden wisely decides to leave the dungeon as quickly as possible, while tasking you to run after the escaping prisoners. You then assemble your team and venture into the mysterious dungeon. A Call For Adventure :Enter a big, massive dungeon, full of danger, mystery and secrets.Fight your way through hordes of enemies and powerful creatures.Explore intricate corridors, underground palaces, mines fallen into oblivion and evil crypts.Solve puzzles, avoid deadly traps, uncover hidden passages, and keep your bearing through mazes & hallways. Character Building :You’ll take command of a party of 4 guardians. Each guardian comes with a set of spells & abilities, with new ones appearing over the course of the adventure.For each new level reached, the guardians get a point to use in their talent trees, allowing them to reinforce their abilities or gain new powers.There are 4 classes to choose from: the warrior, the healer, the mage & the rogue. Each class has 3 specializations represented by a talent tree, and each specialization comes with its own set of abilities. So you have 12 base build-ups. In addition, your guardians can choose freely to spend their talent points in any of the 3 specializations of their class, allowing for even more varied set-ups.The dungeon is filled with loot: epic armors, legendary weapons and mystical, magical items. Often when you kill a group of enemies, they’ll drop a random piece of equipment that one of your guardians can use, raising more and more of their powers. Evolved Combat System :The combat is focused on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism, coupled with an exciting threat mechanism: your healer’s spells directly threaten all the enemies nearby, and thus your tank must use his abilities to attract their wrath and protect the healer. The tank must then be able to mitigate a lot of the enemy damage using his defensive skills.Your last 2 guardians will be the damage dealers, trying to kill the enemies as fast as possible, while they’re busy with the tank.All guardians get a lot of abilities and not only will using the right one at the right moment be essential to your party’s survival, but also combining different abilities in sequence to maximize their efficiency will be required to vanquish your strongest foes.It sounds like a lot, but fortunately the game comes with an active pause: you can pause the game whenever you feel like it, check everything, queue the next abilities for your guardians, and then resume the game.You don’t like tanks, or you don’t like pausing the game? No problem, just lower the game difficulty, and you’ll be able to play without a real tank or pausing. You can precisely tune the difficulty at any time during your exploration.Unlike old-school FPV Dungeon Crawlers, you don’t have to strafe-turn-strafe-turn all the time in Dungeon Guardians. Your tank comes with serious defensive skills (armor, dodge & parry) that let him handle most of the enemy attacks, as long as the healer backs him up. So most fights are done while standing your ground.However, occasionally your whole party will have to dodge some extremely powerful enemy attacks, usually by walking back, so you’ll still need some moving reflexes and awareness of your surroundings during the fights. Built-in Map editor & Modding :The game comes with a full featured map editor, letting you create your own dungeons. The basics are very simple, but a bit of learning will be required to handle the more advanced puzzle mechanisms.Additionally, with the Modding SDK, you’ll be able to fine-tune the existing enemies, classes, specializations, abilities, talents, gear, and enchantments, and with a bit of dedication you should be able to add your own, and even add sound FX or music. Game Features : 4-character Party Grid-based movement : your party moves 1 square at the time, and turns by a quarter First person view 4 classes, 12 specializations 5 playable races : human, dwarf, elf, dark elf, halfling Active pause (ie: you can pause the game and still queue commands for your party members), and numerous optional auto-pauses 25-50 hours of gameplay, depending on your own skills and the difficulty settings 20 bosses, each with an unique strategy 100 kinds of creatures (including variations) Puzzles (the few ones required to finish the game are easy to solve) A lot of tactical combat Built-in Map Editor & Modding support"

clandestine,17909.0,"SummaryClandestine is a 2-player or singleplayer stealth/hacking game set in 1996. Asymmetrical co-op allows one player to take the role of the spy while a friend provides overwatch and assistance as the hacker, and unravel a post-Cold War espionage conspiracy.The year is 1996, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A string of accidents and murders gone mostly unnoticed by the public eye have put the world of international espionage on high alert - veteran Cold War operatives from both sides of the former Iron Curtain are being assassinated around the globe. High-ranking officials of the CIA and the FSB secretly establish a joint task force to investigate the leaks. Codenamed The Kingbridge Executive, the group is funded with whatever money could be skimmed off of official projects and staffed by whoever could be spared from official operations. As field operative Katya Kozlova or hacker Martin Symborski, you will be deployed on dangerous missions across Europe and North America, chasing the source of the leaks.Key FeaturesSingle Player & Asymmetrical co-op: Play as the spy while a friend guides you through the missions or take on the role of the hacker to crack infrastructure and defeat security systems.A return to hard-core stealth games where the enemies are lethal and combat is unforgiving.A deep hacking system built around core stealth game mechanics, rife with options to manipulate the game world and mess with your enemies.Use social engineering in cooperative dialogue sequences to bypass security checkpoints and gain entry to restricted areas.Your actions won't go unnoticed - the story will respond to how much evidence you leave in each mission and how many dead bodies you leave in your wake.Playing as the SpyThe role of the Spy will be familiar to fans of stealth/action games. As the Spy, you will experience Clandestine as a 3rd person game, controlling the movements and actions of Katya in the game world. Katya is the boots on the ground, armed with weapons and gadgets that you can use to stay alive and evade your opponents. Katya is also well trained in hand-to-hand combat, and can use lethal or non-lethal stealth takedowns to take down enemies, leaving behind as little evidence as possible. During the mission, it also falls to the Spy to search for dossiers and intel to unlock new equipment and software for subsequent missions.Playing as the HackerMartin operates in an entirely different way than the spy, which is reflected in the hacker player's interface and game mechanics. As the Hacker, players have access to four game windows and a toolbar. These game windows are: the Camera Feed, the Console, the Network View, and the Tactical Map.Camera FeedThe Camera Feed allows the hacker to observe the game world and scout ahead for the Spy. By default, the Camera Feed displays the Operative Camera (a hidden camera worn by Katya), but you can also jump into surveillance cameras on the Tactical Map (see below) to look through them and scout the levels for enemies and other threats. The Camera Feed also displays the status of the Spy's health.ConsoleThe Console always displays game Objectives at the top of the window and prints important information in the Message Log such as cracked keypad codes. You can also use it to communicate with the Spy via the in-game text chat.Network ViewThe Network View window is where Hackers can access the computer network(s) which run all of the electronic infrastructure in the mission area. This includes door keypads, PCs, Servers, Firewalls, and Hazards (steam pipes and electrical boxes which can be triggered to cause ""accidents""). Hackers must be mindful of the Network Admin, an enemy AI which searches for changes in the Network and tries to correct them. Not only will the Admin kick a hacker from the Network if caught, the Admin will also reset firewalls and pass-codes. Hackers can unlock Viruses and DDOS attacks to keep the Admin busy when trying to escape or complete an objective.Tactical MapThe Tactical Map is the window Hackers use to provide direct support to their Spy partners. This includes gaining access to cameras for scouting and observation, tagging enemies so the spy can track their location without maintaining line-of-sight, and use Local Assets to drop ammo or health, ""clean up"" bodies, cancel alarms before they sound, and even bribe enemies."

magicka-2,3315.0,"Magicka 2 is an action-adventure game developed by Arrowhead Game Studios. The game serves as a direct continuation of the first Magicka. Once upon a time, four mages saved Midgard from complete destruction. However, the war between magic schools broke out after that. Most of the wizards passed away. Humanity entered a Golden Age without the mages destroying the human's way of life. During this period a prophecy of a child that would make Midgard a better place emerges. The prophecy also told that the evil forces will oppose the child. Mages set out on a quest to save the child. The game could be played alone or in a cooperative mode with up to four players. Unlike most role-playing games, Magicka 2 does not feature any class system. Every character is armed with a staff and a melee weapon. Magicka 2 features a high degree of satire and a lot of references to other games. For example, one of the weapons the player can use is the Excalibur or the M60 machine gun crafted by a local blacksmith from a string and a shotgun. The main feature of the game is the dynamic spellcasting system that allows combining 8 elementals in order for the player to choose their own playstyle."

They are blessed with the ability to transform into a crystal and have a prolonged life cycle. These people lose their memories other time, so they are given one specific task to complete. The apocalypse is coming. Only several chosen ones can stop it from happening. Gameplay The game features a real-time combat system that somewhat resembles the same system from the previous games by Square Enix. The players control several playable characters at the time, as when the players assume control over one of the characters, the other characters are handled by the AI. Each character has their own weapon, unique attacks, and abilities, which can be upgraded further into the game if the player has enough points that are gathered after leveling up the characters. The players can focus their attacks on one enemy and execute critical hits on them or get a rare opportunity to one-hit kill the enemy. All the skills of your party can be used together to execute a special combo attack that deals a great amount of damage to the enemy."

uncanny-valley,404.0,"Uncanny Valley is an indie horror game about insanity and supernatural. Style and atmosphere Uncanny Valley is made in the simple 2D pixel-art style with no face animations.

It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter. Uncanny Valley features dark, claustrophobic levels and is set to creepy horror synth / dark ambient music. Plot The plot of Uncanny Valley is nonlinear and strongly depends on the player's choices. The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings. The protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom's love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character's illusions and dreams. Gameplay The player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman's job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets. Occasionally, Tom will fall into his nightmares and have to run away from the shadowy enemies. Tom cannot sprint for too long before his stamina runs out.

kholat,2722.0,"Kholat is the survival horror game centered around the events that took place in real life. Plot The events depicted in the game force the player to explore the world of Kholatsyakhl — Ural mountain, leaving no stone unturned to find the truth about the death of nine students on the Dyatlov Pass. The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary — it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. Gameplay The game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students— the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal. The game is strictly linear giving, however, with the ability to replay the main plot, collecting every possible note. Key features Kholat is often considered to have atmospheric and immersive experience thanks to Shaun Bin voiceover and the unique soundtrack; all of the above is considered as a softening factor for the games various flaws: a bunch of invisible walls, optimization issues and no narrative as a whole."

party-hard,2503.0,"The genre of this game is defined as stealth-action. However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre. Plot Your character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world. In ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting. Gameplay The game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other. After loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people. It is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all. The character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items. There are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear. Bonuses Your character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman. You may have allies, someone you can call for help. There is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon."

overwatch,22508.0,"The Legacy Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago. The story and setting Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar. Continuous support The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins."

Plot The player aims to survive through attacks by armies of demonic monsters for as long as possible. To survive, the player must defeat enemies or avoid contact with them; as the game goes, the monsters become more. The action is taken on a field shrouded in darkness. As a weapon, the protagonist can fire daggers from fingers. Gameplay Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter. As the game starts, the player fetches fire daggers. Then he is transported to the dark arena, where monsters begin to spawn. The goal is to fight off every appearing enemy.

The player can die if he touches an enemy, or if he falls off the stage. After that the player can fetch the red crystals dropping from the top of the screen – it lets them upgrade the daggers.

At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies' guns and ammo or use melee combat.

overcooked!,2115.0,"Overcooked puts the player into the shoes of two restaurant chefs at once. Each level is a kitchen, and your goal is to cook a list of meals following the onscreen recipes. The time is limited, and there are restrictions on how much money the player can spend on the ingredients. The player controls two characters that can be switched at any time or ordered to do a list of actions. The kitchens are often set in the oddball places, such as a pirate ship, two speeding trucks, a pedestrian crosswalk, or an iceberg. The level elements are dynamic and may move or change during the gameplay. Tables and ovens can slide, and the cooks can fall off the level, though they will respawn shortly. There’s a story mode in which cooking is tied to the plot. The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again. Since even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks, the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other. Both modes, however, are local, and there’s no online multiplayer."

tyranny,10039.0,"Tyranny is a plot-driven dark fantasy game. The player assumes the role of a minion at the dark lord's service. Tyranny is a spiritual successor to Pillars of Eternity and uses the same graphics engine and gameplay model. Plot The game is set in a medieval world called Terratus that was almost completely conquered by Kyros, an immortal evil overlord. No one has ever seen Kyros, but he spent four centuries uniting all the realms under his reign. Kyros rules through his powerful viceroys, the Archons, who, in turn, command their minions called Fatebinders. The protagonist is one of Fatebinders at Kyros' service. He or she is sent to the Tiers province that is torn by the conflict. Two of the Kyros' armies fight each other, and it slows down the conquest. The protagonist has to stop the conflict or to be executed. Gameplay The player has to create the main character from scratch and define his or her abilities. The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character's background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character's abilities and the companions the player can recruit. Like in Pillars of Eternity, the player has to make difficult decisions that strongly influence the plot and the lives of NPCs. Every dialogue option may lead to a dramatically different outcome."

ghost-10,10315.0,"""Ghost"" is a metroidvania where two super hackers hire a mysterious agent in order to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal the greatest electronic secret ever. Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent's hidden ties... WEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses. GHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body. UPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are. ITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls. GEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden ""geekies"". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny. SECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special. MAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss. STORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English. GAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: ""classic"" and ""survival"". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die. SKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way. And the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own."

hue,758.0,"In a one-color world, one scholar, working in one of the universities, suddenly discovers the phenomenon of color. But where she works, nobody needs her discovery. And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum. The player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors. Game mechanics based on color In the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game's background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, ""open"" some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated. There are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning. The Mysteries of the Final In addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture."

shadow-warrior-2,9545.0,"Shadow Warrior 2 is a first-person adventure and the second part of the original's title released in 1997 reboot. The company responsible for the original is 3D Realms. Gameplay The player controls the protagonist with the arsenal of 70 weaponry including melee weapons, firearms, and throwables. The weapons may be customized: there are three gem slots in each one with the gems improving different characteristics in the armament. Due to the detailed battle system, it is allowed to cut an enemy into pieces and tear him apart in different ways, shooting, for example, his limbs off. A hero moves through levels, overcomes obstacles and climbs walls. There is no linear structure to the game as early missions can be replayed and newer location re-explored — that is one of the contrasts with the previous installment the title is made. Non-story-related levels are generated procedurally — it means their layout differs from time to time. There is a four-player cooperative mode, in which a party can walk through the same campaign levels together. Plot The narrative centers around Yakuza — the gang is trying to force Lo Wang — the protagonist — to accomplish the job of reclaiming a piece of jewelry from a local Shrine. The story circles around relationships between the characters, mutations due to ancient relics and the adventures in Indiana Jones style."
xanadu-next,14321.0,"Whenever mist hangs over the waters of Lake Orwell on Harlech Island, sailors catch sight of a phantom castle just out of reach. As they draw near, it fades into the fog like a mirage, leaving only questions for all who have borne witness to this “Castle Strangerock.”An up-and-coming scholar named Charlotte L. Wells has had her interest piqued by this local legend and desperately wishes to study it in person—but of course, Harlech Island is no place for an unescorted young lady. To aid her in her investigation, therefore, she enlists the help of an old childhood friend and fallen knight who agrees to accompany her on this adventure.Arriving in Harlech and catching sight of Castle Strangerock almost immediately, Char dives into researching the mystery head-on, leaving her companion to explore the surrounding environs on his own in search of any artifacts that might help trace the origins of this ephemeral stronghold.Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure. Xanadu Next is an exploration-centric action RPG from Nihon Falcom, the acclaimed creators of the Ys and The Legend of Heroes RPG franchises. A late entry in their immensely popular Dragon Slayer series and a spiritual follow-up to the late ‘80s cult classic Faxanadu, Xanadu Next puts players in the shoes of a gravely injured knight given a new lease on life through ancient magic who must now seek a legendary sword called “Dragon Slayer” to ensure his survival.Players will fight hordes of monsters in real time while exploring the lush, mysterious and perilous environments of Harlech Island, along with the ruins of an ancient paradise known as Xanadu that was partially inspired by tales of the Mongolian emperor Kublai Khan. Along the way, players will uncover bits and pieces of Xanadu’s past in the form of ancient stone tablets and memorandums, piecing together a complex tale of magic, war, an ancient dragon, and a mysterious figure known only as the “Black Bride.”FeaturesAn Interconnected World Full of SecretsIcy peaks connect with fiery caverns, old waterways, mystical forests and magical ruins, creating one single giant map to explore with countless secret passageways, alternate routes, shortcuts, hidden items, deadly bosses and new techniques to uncover.Real-Time Combat with Dozens of Unique AbilitiesFight ruthless enemies in real time, using a wide variety of skills to aid you. As in Ys SEVEN, skills are attached to weapons and can be learned through repeated use of those weapons, adding an element of excitement and promise to every new armament found.Exploration Rewarded with Rich BackstoryStone tablets and old letters are scattered throughout the ruins on Harlech Island, each written in an ancient tongue. Fortunately, your companion is an accomplished scholar who can translate them for you in real time, providing valuable insight into important events and mythologies from the age of Xanadu.Unique Gameplay Systems that Keep the Experience FreshPlayers can choose to level-down in order to tweak their stats, fuse themselves with “Guardians” to gain new passive abilities, learn spells, and even carve keys from monster bones to lessen demand for pre-made keys and keep their prices low.Atmospheric Visuals and Music in Classic Falcom TraditionInspired by hardcore dungeon RPGs of the '80s and created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xanadu, one of Japan's action RPG forefathers, Xanadu Next mimics the gritty, medieval look of its ancestor, but in full 3D and with ample amounts of subtle detailing, as well as a foreboding and wholly unique soundtrack composed by Falcom's venerable Sound Team jdk."

shardlight,19313.0,"The world ended on the day the bombs fell. Since then, it’s always been like this: disease, hunger, death. The ruling Aristocrats — a faceless oligarchy that controls all resources — have unchallenged authority. There’s never enough food, water, or vaccine to go around. The rich receive regular doses of vaccinations in exchange for their unconditional government support. The poor live in fear, superstition, and squalor until they die. Amy Wellard, a young woman reluctantly working for the government to qualify for the vaccine lottery, believes there’s a cure — and she’s going to find it. Even if it costs her her life."

gremlins-inc,10091.0,"This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more! HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME? Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH? Yes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons. CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE? Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION? The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES? There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination. MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES This is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics. FACTS & FIGURES 179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release. FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS? You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there. More than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them. A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE) We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal. OUR DLC POLICY We are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics. The game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics). ONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline. AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS The game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience."

epistory---typing-chronicles,13834.0,"Epistory - Typing Chronicles is an action-adventure with a heavy focus on a typing mechanics. This is the only game within the IP. Gameplay Every action in the game is tied with the typing words on the keyboard. Thus, the game cannot be ported onto consoles. Unlike the games similar to this genre, Typing Chronicles utilize every adventure-game mechanics to be adapted to typing words. For example, enemies may not die from one hit, so there are several words above their heads. The meaning of the written information often corresponds to the situation on the screen. Apart from battles, the protagonist may solve puzzles and explore the world. The gameplay is the main attraction of the game — however, it turned its back on the players when it comes to the replayability. The title is monotonous with no gameplay sections without having to type the words. Story The plot tells a story of a poet who sent his muse into the world of unfinished tales to seek for ideas to the next story. The text of the ultimate masterpiece unravels, as Muse proceeds through the levels on her three-tailed fox, changing the environment around her. Somewhere in-between the levels, the semantic idea of interconnecting the meaning with the object faints a little, but the ending is set to explain this minor inconvenience."

mirrors-edge-catalyst,2354.0,"Mirror's Edge Catalyst is the second part in the Mirror's Edge series. Like its predecessor, it is based around parkour simulation. Plot The game is set in the near future that is depicted as a cyberpunk dystopia. The story takes place in the city of Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst. She is a Runner, a person who specializes in illegal delivery. Early in the game, Faith steals a valuable hard drive from a corporation. After reading its data, she learns about the Reflection project that will allow the corporations to control every resident in Glass. Gameplay The game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow. The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies. Style Like its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields."
virginia,1257.0,"Virginia is a silent game that offers the player to become an FBI detective and solve a mystery. It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files. Plot As its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don't trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together. Gameplay Virginia's gameplay is similar to interactive movies and ""walking simulators."" The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what's going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it. Style The game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting. The player can only understand the narrative through the facial expressions and body language of the characters, as well as the other clues."

The bridge has to be strong enough for several vehicles to pass it, let alone the bridge has to hold its own weight. The game does not disable physics after the player is finished with building up the bridge, as each vehicle present in the game has its own weight and length, so the player-built structure has to be adaptive in some cases. For example, long vehicles, such as cargo trucks, will not be able to ride on steep constructions, so the bridge has to adjust itself based on the weight of the vehicle. There are also several obstacles for the player-built bridges present in the game, as sometimes a boat can spawn on the level and try to swim under the bridge. Storms are also a vital part of the gameplay, as the players have to also take into the amount the power of wind and adjust their creation as well. The main catch of the game is that the players do not have unlimited resources, so they will have to make the best out the things at hand. Several types of materials are present in the game with each material having a certain amount of strength.

corpse-party,2172.0,"Kisaragi Academy student Mayu Suzumoto is transferring to a new high school, leaving behind a sizable group of friends and countless lovely memories. To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them. Corpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.KEY FEATURESHighly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere Modeled after the very first RPG Maker Corpse Party, the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display. Adventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference Playing like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, Corpse Party gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do. Chapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content The tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, recreated with added content in classic Corpse Party adventure style. Original Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature Over 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze. The Game That Started It All When first released in 2008, this title sparked a Corpse Party boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless Corpse Party-inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style. Come see how it all began, and experience the horror the way it was meant to be seen..."

bohemian-killing,10264.0,"Steampunk Paris, set against the background of the late 19th century, torn between tradition and modernity. Class differences and pervasive racism finally lead to a tragedy. A year later you find yourself on trial, accused of a brutal murder. How far will you go to exonerate yourself? Will you lie, seek evidence to prop your testimony or, perhaps, pretend to be insane? Your imagination is the limit. OVERVIEWBohemian Killing is a narrative-driven courtroom drama, offering players almost unlimited possibilities of solving the lawsuit, thanks to the complete integration of gameplay and narrated story. It is also the first law-themed game made by a real-life lawyer!STORYLINEWelcome to Paris of the late 19th century. The aftermath of the Great Revolution offered a new start for each and every citizen, regardless of social class. Alfred Ethon, a young inventor of Gypsy origin, benefits from the change, becoming a symbol of success thanks to his hard work and innovative projects, well ahead of their time.Soon, a young woman is brutally murdered - a maid working for an impoverished Lord, a relic of the old French regime. Is Alfred Ethon to be blamed for the murder? The evidence points towards him... But you can change that.As you stand before the court, all you can count on is your own intellect and creativity. But how does that look in practice?GAMEPLAYGameplay in Bohemian Killing is a combination of a courtroom drama, and a walking simulator. It can be classified as a first person experience, or a first person interactive story adventure game.The story is set within two time frames. In the present, you find yourself locked up in the courtroom. You're getting acquainted with the evidence, witness testimony and questions posed by the Judge. Each question triggers a flashback - and begins your testimony. During the flashback you find yourself in a Parisian district, with each of your decisions, interactions and action affecting Alfred Ethons' testimony and the final verdict.To help you in your testimony, you'll have access to all the evidence gathered on the case - expert opinions, reports and witness testimonies. Each of them can be (but doesn't have to be!) refuted in a number of different ways.In the Evidence menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories, making them easy to find.Sample:A neighbor testified that at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house, noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so. Or maybe you'll get into a bar fight just a few minutes before, so that you can testify that the blood the neighbor saw was yours, and not the victim's? Or maybe you will cut yourself while shaving, covering your clothes with blood that the neighbor sees later? But what if the court finds your time of shaving conspicuous and torments you with even more questions? How will you get out of this?With a wide range of possibilities that can lead to several standard endings and one additional hidden one, the game doesn't consider any path ""a bad one"", ensuring that each playthrough will be different.To adjust the game to the preferences of each player, two modes are available:In the Standard mode, the outcome depends entirely on your creativity and ability to solve logical problems. You will suffer the consequences of your own actions.In the Story mode, your attorney will advise you as you progress along, commenting on your decisions and choices, preventing you from acting in a way that might prove to be harmful in the eyes of the court. VOICE ACTINGThe main character of the game is played and dubbed by a world-class film and voice actor, Stephane Cornicard!Stephane Cornicard studied in France, at the prestigious Colby College in the US, and at Goldsmith College in the UK.

The battles take place in one of the five areas, each with its distinct visual themes, such as jungle or lava. Each map is centered around the Middle Orb that can be destroyed to gain additional power and will respawn over the course of the game. Matches are divided into rounds and, to win a match, a team has to score three round victories. Each round has a two-minute time limit, so as to push players toward a fast-paced gameplay.

There are more than 20 characters, or ""champions"" to choose from, and the roster continues to grow. Those champions include magicians, warriors and everything in between. Each champion has his or her unique set of nine skills. Timing is important when using characters' abilities, as a low-level skill used at the right time can deal more damage than a mistimed high-level spell."

Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one’s faith in the Goddess.

You can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries. Plort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics. Slimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes. To get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important. Gameplay and economics Slimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves. It is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources. From different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water. Slimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode. Some slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment. Ordinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime. Game modes Adventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. Carefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier. The five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.

Along the way they’ll meet the isle’s strange and colorful residents, battle the minions of darkness, train pets, learn potent skills from a macho masked luchador, and discover the meaning of (slightly dysfunctional) friendship.

Low temperatures, hungry animals like wolves and bears, and starvation can easily kill your character. To stay alive, he will need to learn how to light a campfire, find shelter, care about his wounds, hunt for food and protect himself in an unfriendly environment. Many necessary items in the game, including some of the weapons, need to be crafted out of the junk that you can find in the woods and in abandoned buildings. In the story mode, called Wintermute, you control a pilot, Will Mackenzie, who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually, his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured, and Astrid is missing, presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion. Wintermute follows a linear plot and only allows you to explore a limited area. However, it is recommended to start with, since it serves as a sort of tutorial to the open-world sandbox mode. This is the most popular mode, in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas."

The ship is carrying thousands of passengers in suspended animation, and the Pathfinders’goal is to find them a habitable planet to call home.

ark-survival-evolved,9810.0,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

Rescue help is on the way, the past must remain hidden. ""They can't find out who we are!""​Inspirations include Dear Esther, Gone Home and Firewatch as well as dark character dramas like Homeland, Lost, and The Americans. ​The Fidelio Incident was also inspired by Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio. We use the opera's premise as inspiration for the backstory, then re-imagined it for a modern setting.Michael Krikorian's score composes over 40 minutes of original music. He incorporates themes from Fidelio's overture and transforms them to fit the mood and atmosphere of the game. The score expands the emotional depth of the narrative while complementing the atmosphere of the island. ​Stanley is played by Glenn Keogh, known for his roles in Transformers Age of Extinction, Once Upon A Time, and Sons of Anarchy. Glenn was born in Ireland. After reading the script, he signed on with the goal of bringing authenticity to Stanley's character. We think he did a great job, and hope you agree!​Leonore is played by Bess Harrison, whose credits include The Temple and Memory, for Amazon Studios. Bess is described by Glenn as having a sweetheart voice you can't help but fall in love with.The Game Runs On Unreal Engine 4."

formula-fusion,12350.0,"Formula Fusion is an anti-gravity racing game which pits your racing pedigree up against the rest of the world. Tackle the single player campaign and become the best pilot against the AI over leagues and championships, or play against the world in multiplayer and compete in a sports league where you can take either yourself or your team to the top step. Track Technology Tracks are made up of magnetic superconductors that suspend the craft within a gravitational field using super-cells, cooled by liquid nitrogen. This Quantum Levitation effect allows the craft to skim along the track at incredibly high speeds whilst remaining suspended above the track surface. Magnetic side buffers create an invisible barrier to dampen impact at high speeds whilst holographic digital elements serve to update your HUD with visual feedback. Weapon Technology You are able to research new technology to add to craft weapon slots, which you can activate during race-time. Weapons and counter-measures in Formula Fusion are all digital. Once you use one you will need to re-charge them to reactivate them again. This will allow the player to choose to be either aggressive or defensive and as you progress through the craft stages more slots will be made available. Handling and Features With enhancements to the traditional way of AG craft handling we have developed our own hybrid, a mixture of physics and spline control. In addition to the craft technology we have developed, we will create a garage system that allows you to fine tune your craft to your own specification. Tracks will be designed with many track themes and dynamic track surfaces. Track features will include corkscrews, twists, banks, jumps, and more. Gameplay Gameplay includes a layer of technology research and craft customization through the team garage facility, along with competitive ‘edge of your seat’ style racing in the various classes working your way from FF4000 Racing Class through to the aerodynamic FX1000 Hyper Sports leagues. Along with the base game modes we also aim to bring you visceral ‘in-cockpit’ F1 style action and synchronous eSports Racing Leagues. The game will have features such as ghost mode, collaborative F1 style team play, races, and leagues. Motivation The game represents not only a next generation reboot of the classic AG Racing genre, but also a drive to bring back the core tried and tested elements from the most successful and most cherished AG Racing titles ever made including a thumping soundtrack, The Designers Republic inspired art, fast paced gameplay, fun tracks, and addictive gameplay. Game Setting The game is set in and around New York State 50 years after the cataclysmic events of an all-out global nuclear war rendering most areas uninhabitable. Redevelopment on a vast scale has all but papered over the cracks, with many districts almost unrecognisable. The division between rich and poor is the greatest it has ever been with Favela style slums and make-shift buildings forming poverty stricken rings around affluent commercial districts. The year is 2075. 177 years since man first got behind the wheel of a car and raced against a competitor. Through the years, advances in science and technology have pushed the field of Quantum Levitation to a degree that allows modern transportation to be suspended within artificially created gravity fields above magnetic super-conducted highways. Along with transportation, this technology became embedded in motor sport racing; the pomp and celebration of what was Formula 1, evolved to become FORMULA FUSION – QUANTUM RACING LEAGUES. The racing calendar is now established as a global sporting event that brings technology and science together like never before. Because of the high level of technical competition and the huge levels of investment the race attracts - the traditional corporate backed race teams have given way to huge University based research facilities, and each team is now represented on a national level by these huge schools of excellence. These Mega-Universities are often the size of large cities with their own economies and laws. With competition for research funding high, each race season is as much about showcasing the skills of the pilots as it is the performance of the craft. Competition to attract the best researchers and engineers to these institutions is fierce with big money headhunting common place. Craft pilots are nurtured from birth and conditioned into becoming perfect testing machines to support this drive for success. Universities regularly publish their standings in the global research tables and this in turn allows them to achieve greater funding and expansion. Formula Fusion is a perfect testing grounds for the latest in hardware and science innovations. To support the research surrounding the event, Universities have focused their research into 4 key areas of innovation. These are represented in the Garage Technology Trees: - Weapon Systems - Propulsion Systems - Craft Materials - Quantum Physics Planned Game Features - 7 themed zones: each containing 3 tracks and a final championship track resulting in 22 variations - 10 National racing teams / research institutes: each with different research specialties - Branding and graphic design from The Designers Republic – A perfect marriage of style and content - Customisable Race Settings - New weapon technology: research new technology and adapt your own style of play - New game modes and meta-games: including an integrated Zone style mode and garage missions - Local split screen and synchronous multiplayer aspect with Replay Ghost - Team research garage: craft upgrade mechanic and race analytics through the front end - Records, awards and eSPORTS racing leagues (format to be confirmed): through our eSports partner ESL - 5 unlockable Craft Classes available at key upgrade/advance stages: including a team specific X-Technology craft - Potential VR Integration: for visceral cockpit action"

empyre-lords-of-the-sea-gates,46497.0,"OverviewIn 1899, the coastal cities of the world flooded. In New York City, most people left. But some didn’t. Those people banded together into groups forming their own City-States. Italian immigrants in Little Italy formed the Mano Nera City-State, the police and government workers became the Tammany City-State and so on. Determined to survive and even thrive in this hostile environment, they turned to the sea for sustenance. What they could not provide themselves, they traded for with the “Mainlanders”. Fresh water pumped into the city through pipes. One day, the water stops flowing through the pipes. As the city watches it’s water reserves run lower and lower, it is you who will attempt to save them…FeaturesSuperb Story: Our game was penned by distinguished author and cartoonist Paul Noth.

Our goal was to provide you with the familiar experience of looting, questing, character progression and more just like the old school games did. Aside from the graphical upgrade to the present day, we also wanted to forge our own path in the way we tell stories and the world we create for you. The 19th Century has a wealth of experiences to draw from that you don’t typically see in most games. That gives us a chance to give you something new. To give a few examples: Successful politicians were those with the largest gang of thugs and control over the Polling Stations. Workers Unions were coming of age around this time with frequent strikes and many times, strikebreakers. In gambling dens, dogs would fight rats. This is a sampling of some of the ideas we worked with in telling our stories. We also wanted you to feel that our world has a sense of Authenticity. In a flooded, Neo-Victorian version of New York, that sounds a little far-fetched. Yet, we did our research. You will meet real life figures from the era: Monk Eastman, Mock Dock, Silent Charlie Murphy. You will visit real life locations: The Tombs Prison, the Brooklyn Bridge. You will consume real life medicines when your party is in trouble: Goulard’s Extract, Hunt’s Remedy, Shoo-Fly Powder for Drunkenness. That is if you trust Victorian era medicine...

inner-chains,9531.0,"An FPS horror game set in a surreal, dark and deadly biomechanical world never seen before. One does not get to set the rules in the world of Inner Chains. Humankind is just a small part of a hostile universe. Want to survive? Discover its secrets. A planet in the distant future. A rock floating in space that is no longer what it had once been. Without human interference, nature has been adapting to the new conditions, reclaiming what was once taken away. In its pursuit of perfection, it began to assimilate with the abandoned technology giving life to biomechanical beings. Left to its own devices, man-made technology has also changed as it tried to adjust to the new environment. A strong symbiosis soon developed between technology and nature. It became difficult to determine what is alive and what is mechanical in the world of Inner Chains. After several million years of biomechanical evolution, mankind once again became an important part of the ecosystem. However, it hasn’t regained an advanced stage of development. As a result, the human race, oblivious to its own history, cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planet’s resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith, dominance, oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes, and, in consequence, to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first, learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit. As one of the inhabitants of this world, your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated, dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal, but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival, face hostile fauna and flora, and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the game’s world. Your survival depends entirely on your watchfulness, logical judgment, quick reflexes, accuracy and the ability to use the environment to your advantage.

dead-cells,11726.0,"Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin. Story Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. Gameplay The game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers. Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias. The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves."
return-of-the-obra-dinn,46508.0,"In 1802, the merchant ship ""Obra Dinn"" set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea. Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment. (""Obra"" is pronounced like ""Cobra"" without the C). From the author: Goals I want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical ""collect items and look for clues"" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later. Devlog I'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time. 1-bit Rendering My first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes. Unity 3D I'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes."

subnautica,10419.0,"Subnautica is a first-person game about survival in the deep sea. You control Ryley Robinson, a space traveler in the 22nd century, who crash-landed his starship on a planet that is covered almost entirely by the ocean. The protagonist needs to eat and drink, although this can be disabled in lower difficulty modes. He can desalinate oceanic water, catch or gather the seafood, and create useful tools and structures. Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined. The game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent. The environment is randomly generated to improve replayability."
rimworld,12130.0,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.Fashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Fight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.Trade with passing ships and trade caravans.Decorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Build colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com.(All non-English translations are made by fans.)"

battlefield-v,58494.0,"Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. Plot Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”. Gameplay Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach. The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons. Modes Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations.

soulcalibur-vi,50736.0,"Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series. Plot The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him. Gameplay The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There's also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time. Characters The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned.

la-mulana-2,59154.0,"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style ""archaeological ruin exploration action game"".In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title’s hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.You won’t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.The question we’ve asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruinsGather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruinsDive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progressA detailed and beautifully dot-rendered worldSeven main weapons and over ten sub-weaponsOver 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruinsOver 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer’s tablet, the ""Mobile Super X3""Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the gameLumisa Kosugi(21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist)Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child.

Rosemary’s investigations will bring her to believe that the disappearance of the man’s daughter Celeste actually hides a terrible massacre. Dr. Felton and his wife, Arianna, could be the only ones to know the truth, including the secret behind Celeste’s real identity and a fanatic cult of cloistered nuns in red.

The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by.

my-memory-of-us,47396.0,"Do you like stories? If so, then I’ll tell you one. But it won’t be just any old story. It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again. What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other.

Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body. The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas. In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation.

Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests.

call-of-cthulhu,58831.0,"Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is a psychological horror game adapted from the 1981 tabletop role-playing game of the same name by Chaosium. It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general. Plot The game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce's investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity. Gameplay The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane. His mental state affects the gameplay."

Can the crew manage to survive and get back home? SYMMETRY is a micro-management survival game set in a retro- futuristic, sci-fi universe. Your main goal is to manage the crash survivors and help them withstand the desolate, extremely cold environment in order to fix their spacecraft and escape. The non- obvious plot is accompanied by an atmospheric musical score and graphic design that sustains the harsh and mysterious ambience.Survivors’ life functions crucial to their existence, such as eating, resting and mental health need to be taken care of. Extreme circumstances may force crew members to develop new skills like botanics or power plant operations, that weren't necessary in their Earthly life. Gathering all the parts required to repair the spaceship becomes a race against time, as extreme weather conditions and life-threatening supernatural activities become more and more present.

x4-foundations,46058.0,"Freedom to personally fly all ships: X4 will allow you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. Additionally some drones and utility vehicles in X4 can be remotely controlled by the player. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Modular stations and ship upgrades: Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Most dynamic X universe ever: X4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe. Managing your empire with a powerful map: Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Most detailed X economy ever: One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and Teleportation: The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders. Get into the game: In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide."

fallout-76,58585.0,"Fallout 76 is a multiplayer-only game set in the universe of Fallout series. It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series. Setting The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore. Gameplay Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other's settlements."

bullet-witch,60191.0,"First, there was the earthquake. Then the war, then the plague, then the riots. In the span of a few short years, humanity suffered every disaster imaginable — and all as a prelude to the one we couldn't have imagined. An army of literal demons marched straight out of Hell, trampling over the survivors wherever they found them. When they killed, they wore their victims' skins. When they conquered, they seized their enemies' weapons. Powered by supernatural evil and loaded with military hardware, they scattered us and ran us down. But then she came. At first, we thought she was one of them — a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will. Maybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ First released on the Xbox 360 in 2006, Bullet Witch offered a unique combination of Japanese dark-fantasy aesthetics and Western-style military action. This PC re-release brings the title to a new generation of gamers, improving the resolution, framerate, lighting, and game balance. After an army of demons takes over the world, the human resistance is on the brink of collapse. Just when all hope seems lost, a woman in black appears on the battlefield. She possesses a long gun like a witch's broom and an array of magical powers to match. Taking on the role of this mysterious savior, Alicia, you’ll fight through hordes of demon soldiers, mutated civilians, and even giants.KEY FEATURES This Is My Broomstick Alicia's gunrod can transform on the fly into four different weapons, each of which can be enchanted for extra punch and special perks. Mow down enemies to charge your magic meter, then can call down thunderbolts, tornadoes, and even meteors to blast the rest of them to kingdom come. Few gaming heroines have ever wielded as much raw power as Alicia at her peak. The Path of Destruction Nothing is safe from your wrath, least of all the environment around you. Your magic can tear the roofs off of buildings, ignite an entire gas station, or level towers. If any enemies survive, use your telekinesis on the rubble to throw it at them and crush them flat. You Are Not Alone Your strength and bravery will inspire the battle-hardened resistance fighters around you, and soon enough, they'll fight by your side. Use your magic to keep them alive, and they just might return the favor. All DLC Included The PC release of Bullet Witch includes all the original game's costumes and bonus missions for free. (Beat the game once to unlock the latter; the costumes are available from the start.)"

From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing. With both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season – comprising five sprint events and five endurance events – crowns the world’s most complete GT drivers. A Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world’s leading 24-hour races."

beyond-two-souls,3028.0,"This game is often called an ""interactive film"" - because the proportion between the given story and the possibilities to influence the story is indeed somewhat different than in most games. The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years. Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people's consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies. Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak. The CIA is interested in Jodie's abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them. The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi's forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same."

dead-or-alive-6,60474.0,"[Introduce DOA Series] The Dead or Alive franchise is a AAA fighting game series produced by Koei Tecmo Games' Team NINJA. Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original Dead or Alive in 1996, Dead or Alive 6 will be the sixth entry in the series. This game features fighting entertainment with multi-tiered stages that are now both dynamic and critical parts of the competitive experience. [Story] The story will follow that of Dead or Alive 5, shedding light on 2 main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the tournament “Dead or Alive 6”. New episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] The visuals of DOA6 express dramatic lighting that goes beyond the genre of “fighting games” and focus on serious, intense combat. It also features improved skin and sweat textures, introducing wounds, as well as flexible, varied facial animations. [Triangle System] Fights in Dead or Alive 6 are based on a Traditional triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. When you land an attack of one type that beats another type, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, that attack becomes a Hi Counter attack and does even more damage. [Break Actions - New Combat Mechanics] With this title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, making the fights more strategic than ever before. Because the actions can be performed by simply pressing the [RB] button, even beginners can enjoy the new system. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks the opponent away. The first part of the move also parries attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] Players can achieve unique combos by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. Beginners can even play by using this move exclusively, though its disadvantages will prove to be a calculated risk for more experienced players.[New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked into a large stack of nearby boxes with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush”, they will plow through them all in one hit! This causes a huge burst of damage and provides an exhilarating rush."

felix-the-reaper,244784.0,"Felix works at The Ministry of Death and is in love with Betty The Maiden from The Ministry of Life. He believes that going to the human world as a field reaper will enable him to one day meet her. Hence he’s taken the job of making sure people die and taught himself to dance to impress Betty. Since Felix only moves in the shadows, he needs to manipulate those shadows to move around. Luckily reapers like Felix are able to turn the sun and move shadowing objects, which enables him to create the necessary shadow paths to get around. He does so to solve the adventure plots, that makes people die according to the ministerial plans. Each level unlocks a hardcore version of itself for the striving ministerial achiever. You can also collect skull achievements, that further unlock bonus time trials for the extremely resourceful ministerial employee. • Challenge yourself to original puzzle game mechanics • Experience a gruesomely sweet and beautiful story world • Choose your own tune from a selection of 10+ indie music artists on Felix‘ Walkman • Collect skull achievements that further unlock bonus time trials • Watch Felix‘ dance moves develop as created by professional dancers Felix The Reaper has sprung from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. The history contains both The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden as two central themes going through it. We sort of mashed those two together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him the inspiration was more diverse: in that aspect, the game contains inspiration from the ancient tv-show The Twilight Zone, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki. Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper were the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We've worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and historian scholars.The DanceSeveral dancers have been around throughout the production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves, that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix: And here's Raphael doing another: The MusicOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music - why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. That makes for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.The Art HistoryThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis and then asked ourselves: how can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. Parallel to the production a historical scholar has dived into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it in the game, if it fit. There's five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game, that you can unlock as you progress."

It also creates new stories, which, thanks to the full creative license, will be incorporated as official lore of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.What is Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York? Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York aims to translate the complex and fascinating world of vampires, their nightly struggles for power and attempts to hold on to their humanity, to a format previously unexplored by the brand - an atmospheric narrative experience. Think interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas, answers to which are entirely up to the players, allowing them to reach one of a variety of possible endings.How does Coteries of New York play? You act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you’ll meet different NPCs – other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs.

You’ll go through the main quest, side quests and loyalty quests (aimed to build closer relations between the protagonist and members of your Coterie). BUT one playthrough is definitely not enough to see every piece of content we’ve prepared. As for post-launch support, you can definitely expect new, standalone stories, enriching the lore, telling different bloody stories from the history of vampiric New York and adding new twists to interpersonal plots.Which platforms will Coteries of New York be available on? Coteries of New York will be available on PC (Windows, MAC OS, Linux) and Nintendo Switch. The game will launch on both platforms simultaneously.

Coteries of New York will be released in Q4 2019! We’ll unveil the final date when we’re closer to launch.Which language versions will be supported?

As Coteries of New York will launch simultaneously on PC and Switch, you’ll be able to play the PC version both with mouse and keyboard, as well as with a controller.

truberbrook-a-nerd-saves-the-world,62499.0,"»Trüberbrook« is a thrilling mystery-sci-fi adventure game. Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery. Imagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world … Suspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all, it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained! Join American student Tannhauser, stranger in a strange land Set in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s Inspired by Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Stranger Things & Star Trek Indulge in universal themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, self-discovery and dinosaurs Handmade miniature scenery! English and German localization with full voice acting! Atmospheric, moody soundtrack Coming to Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation®4 & Nintendo Switch A likely mobile port later! Up to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay! Release scheduled for late 2018 – not the longest wait! Trüberbrook was successfully funded on Kickstarter in December 2017 within only 30 hours. The game will be enhanced by several new features thanks to the joint force of our 5078 wonderful backers! <3 The year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin. On a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, Trüberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity. But shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why? Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Gretchen Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Gretchen becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world! As the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft. Tannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature. Tannhauser is played by Justin Beard. Gretchen Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village. Gretchen Lemke is played by Nora Tschirner. As much a reclusive inventor as it gets, Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft? Lazarus Taft is played by Dirk von Lowtzow. Trüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, ""the weird kid"" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few. One of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers! Not the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made. The models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters. It is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done! Every scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke. This way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook. Trüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative. You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests. For the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation. The soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits, Angelo Badalamenti, Mark Lanegan, Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader. We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors. In the international English version, the main character Tannhauser speaks American English, while the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport a (more or less) German accent. In the German version, it's vice versa: the protagonist might have a modest American accent, while the townspeople welcome him in regular German, most likely with a dialect. Both approaches bear a certain degree of entertainment, each in their own way."
espire-1-vr-operative,46907.0,"Espire 1: VR Operative is an ambitious new virtual reality game and IP with its sights firmly set on the single-player ‘stealth’ genre, currently available through Steam's Alpha Release Channel in its prototype phase. We pitch this as ""Goldeneye 007"" meets ""Metal Gear Solid"" in an immersive VR world. The prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics. With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement. The full game features 15 objective-based missions and 200 Virtual Challenges."

Alex’s search for the woman and the truth behind her disappearance lead him and his companions towards the new millennium, on a journey rife with mystery and danger... or so goes the tale of YIIK: A Postmodern RPG, the surreal Japanese-style RPG from Ackk Studios and Ysbryd Games. Battle through dungeons littered with puzzles, traps, and bizarre monsters with a party of up to eight members, using a combat system that blends twitchy minigames with turn-based combat.

fade-to-silence,50572.0,"As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons. “You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today. The wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?” Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming. “You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws. Then you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice? Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area. Wolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long term expeditions into the farthest regions. Fight System: Tiered weapon system, melee and ranged combat. Moral choices: Save and recruit various NPCs to join your group. Harsh choices have to be made; who do you take, who do you leave behind.

grimshade,60543.0,"Grimshade is a story-driven tactical RPG featuring a turn-based combat system and non-linear progression, set in a fantasy world. Lead a group of adventurers on a journey through the world of Ree'Fah. Each decision you make has a profound influence on the characters, the game's story and the way battles are fought. Explore a varied and intricate world, meet new characters, reveal plot-related secrets and go treasure hunting; the world around changes as you advance and directs you further through the story. Proper positioning and awareness contribute more to your success than stat gains; Control the character's performance during battles through party and equipment management available outside the battlefield; Large locations full of quests, secrets, dangers, and rewards for the player to explore; A living world where the environment, characters, and animations are hand-drawn and carefully put together by our artists, sets the atmosphere of your journey. A branching narrative, that makes the game's progress depend strongly on your choices; Gameplay Grimshade is a fabulous adventure during which you explore a vast and rich world and fight formidable enemies. The gameplay is divided into two distinct phases - adventure and combat. Adventure Adventure mode is your exciting journey through Ree'Fah world. As well as progressing the story at your own pace, you will discover different races, acquire better equipment and meet new characters. You are free to move within the area and choose your destinations: it's up to you to decide whether to go to the nearest city or to look around in the current location, to complete some quests (and which ones) or to test your strength in a difficult dungeon. After completing all the plot-related quests, you leave the area to the next and never come back. Unique residents with rich history inhabit each area you visit. Embrace the spirit of the local culture and spend your time interacting with the natives — you are sure to find something to help you on your main quest or discover a whole new adventure to go on. Of course, when the stakes are this high, conflict is unavoidable, so prepare for battle by choosing the right tools for the job - find, trade for, or craft a wide range of equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable. Combat system We spent a lot of time and effort developing our unique approach to battles and making them as interesting and exciting as possible. Any unexpected turn of events can get you into a fight. The world is also inhabited by a lot of hostile creatures that you will have to defeat in the course of events. At the start, you will have to pick a squad from your character's team including up to 4 members. The battle takes place on a stage consisting of two opposite fields, where characters and enemies are located on their respective sides. Characters move and act in a specific order according to their initiative. We developed a unique scenario for each battle. Each new enemy has their own features diversifying the fights and making you experiment and seek new approaches to succeed in the combat encounters. Naturally, each new battle requires more skill than the previous one. We have not forgotten about the tactical battles lovers. Some locations in Grimshade include special missions - hostile dungeons of a higher level of complexity. Here, every encounter with the boss turns into a mortal game of wits. Think over your strategy and prepare a squad that will be able to go through the dungeon in one go. In the end, you'll get a well-deserved reward! Heroes Although Grimshade is a single-player game, you won't be traveling alone. Advancing through the story, you'll get acquainted with seven heroes. Their personalities, focus, and backgrounds are pre-set, but you can control their skills and develop the relationship between the party members. We hope to add another hero soon after reaching one of the goals, and the script of the game suggests twelve of them. Story After the Great Flood, being torn apart by the heirs of Amon Darvish the Great and long-running civil war, the Kingdom of Easeon split into three states. Ree'Fah witnessed the dark age for both livs and eleores. Nevertheless, after years of wandering, each group of people still managed to find a haven from the dreadful lands of the Hardfore continent, inhabited by monsters. Amazing technologies, the legacy of ancestors, secret knowledge of the world's nature, great and splendid objectives of the future were lost forever during battles for survival and hard work on settling the new society on the ruins of ancient cities, hostile wastelands, and dangerous mountain highlands. Eighty years have passed. When old wounds almost healed and people just embarked on the road to prosperity, new enemy forces gained the power to enter the scene, threatening the fragile stability of every living creature's life in the world. Art During one and a half years of development, the visual component of Grimshade has changed a lot. From a stylized watercolor environment with 2D characters, we moved on to adding 3D models of characters to the 2D world, creating our own shader, and a detailed environment. Our artists drew the whole game by hand and carefully put it together, that's why the world of Ree'Fah is full of life even in the most secluded corners. Hope you can feel this!"

Super Sexy Software started in spirit in 2013, when the first echoes of The Shattering started to take form. The project began from studying the contrast of white and black in horror and culture. The core theme draws on the premise that horrors and fear can be achieved through embracing white and the absence of information, rather than darkness and the obvious, though unseen, enemy.Over various iterations, the game took shape and the decision was made to work on it in every spare moment that could be found. With members of the team residing in Poland, France and Switzerland, they grew in experience and efficiency as the true spirit of the studio was born. As the game progressed, the developers and Deck13 met at a networking event and the synergy between the companies resonated immediately. A publisher was found, and all the ingredients to finish The Shattering were ready.With the full development spanning multiple years, births and deaths, tears and laughter, the only joy greater than that of the journey together as one team and family, is the joy of seeing The Shattering take shape and be played by people around the world. We’d like to thank you, the player, for taking interest in our passion. We hope our story can echo out and reach gamers around the world."
