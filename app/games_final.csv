He is a larger-than-life masked champion of goodness on a quest to save the world. His goal is to find The Artifact, an object so mysterious that nothing is known about it: neither its shape nor its purpose.

To complete his quest, DeathSpank needs assistance from local people, who, in return, send him on multiple side quests.

The combat system is essentially the same as in Diablo. The protagonist can obtain and use various types of weapons and armor and perform comb movements.

While practising a particularly tricky juggling move, he accidentally taints a barrel of rum with tobacco, creating a potent and addictive brew which he coins ‘Jolly Rover’, one of the most prized substances in the Caribbean.

Beat Hazard,beat-hazard,70.0,7.2,"Apr 15, 2010","{""Shoot-'Em-Up"", 'Shooter', 'Action', 'Top-Down', 'Static'}",E,"Beat Hazard is a game in which everything is synchronized to your favorite music. Gameplay-wise, it’s a regular 2D shoot ’em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks. What makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player’s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot ’em up. Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness. The game’s visuals are very bright and feature many rapid flashes, which makes Beat Hazard not recommended for people with epilepsy.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/49600/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/cc7f26b3b5315ac57f97dba32822188a-98.jpg

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this ""Tiberium Control Network"" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind. After 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress.

You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her... Portal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them. The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic.

The game has implemented some of the gloomiest predictions about global warming: the world ocean level has risen so much that the continents have gone under water, and people have only to swim between the remaining islets on huge floating ark cities. You control the captain of such an ark - and this means that you will have to explore, discover and colonize islands, build trade routes, build cities, meet the needs of the population, mine and mine food, build all kinds of enterprises, mines and fleets. Gameplay The entire Anno series is characterized by a general scheme - the player has to develop unpopulated but resource-rich territories, adjusting their economies, and then move on in search of new undeveloped territories. In the Anno 2070 there is the same scheme, but its concrete implementation this time focuses on maintaining the ecological balance during colonization. Various approaches to this problem embody the main actors in the game: - the classic industrial tycoons from the Global Trust Corporation - rely on coal and nuclear power plants - the environmentally-minded governing bodies of the Eden Initiative Corporation - these people rely more on renewable energy sources, wind energy or falling water. The magnates, if you go their way, provide a more rapid development, but the population is dissatisfied with the deterioration of living conditions. Environmentalists are developing more slowly, but the situation becomes softer. But not everything is so primitive - both the magnates and the environmentalists have no ready answers to all the questions. Environmentalists also have to deal with environmental pollution, and the magnates, if they wish, can build waste treatment plants and make their strategies more acceptable.

A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped ""ports"" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/223830/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/aaf7e136d935e9d50c0c8ac09f7ba7c5-98.jpg

Assume the role of a mighty (and mighty evil) Dungeon Lord and create your own diabolical demesnes underground. Dim-witted goblin workers tremble as they await your orders and dig corridors and rooms into the rock at your command. Heroes will visit your dungeon in search of battle and treasure. Naturally, you could always just annihilate them with a snap of your fingers. But isn't it more entertaining and deliciously evil to watch them attain their heart's desire - and then take take it ALL away? So throw them a few treasures and some equipment, give them a couple of fights for entertainment and cherish and look after them. And once they are finally happy enough - it's time for the ""harvest"". For happy heroes have more valuable soul energy for you to gleefully extract from them in your prison or torture chamber! But even though these self-proclaimed warriors for the good are not much more than an excellent source of resources for you, you still should not underestimate them. If you've beaten up too many of their friends, the powerful and vindictive Champions will occasionally make their way to your Dungeon.

He falls victim to a devious plot hatched by his vile, nasty, thoroughly vicious ex-girlfriend Calypso, and suddenly finds himself at the bottom of the hierarchy and the top of the dungeon once again.

Battles are all also turn-based like in the reference, but by using an object or weapon, the player has to move the main character and hit the enemies, dodging their attacks. As the name implies, the main battles take place after random encounters. The main character can be joined by new characters, at levels you can find new weapons.

Hydrophobia Prophecy includes both new levels (updated approximately 70% of the content) and levels already exist, but have undergone significant processing. Both the original and the reworked version of the game are created as part of the action-adventure genre with elements of survival horror in the cyberpunk style. Place and time of action The game takes place in the middle of the XXI century. By this time, the world is plunged into chaos caused by great overpopulation. Lands suitable for food production are destroyed by rising ocean levels and the spread of deserts. Hunger and misery reign in the world. The most precious resource of humanity in these conditions is simple drinking water. The game takes place on board a giant cruise liner comparable in size to the city. The liner is called Queen of the World, it was built by a group of giant corporations to create comfortable conditions for the elected representatives from among the managers of these corporations. History At the very beginning of the game, a group of terrorists is attacking and seizing a ship. The terrorists call themselves ""Neo Malthusians"" (after the economist Thomas Malthus, who predicted the death of humanity from overpopulation). They plan to kill many people so that the world will return to a state fit for a full life. Attacking the liner, the terrorists painted the walls with their slogans, the same slogans are broadcast on screens all over the ship. One of the slogans: “Save the World - Kill Yourself!”. The terrorists are attacking a diner to get a tool for global genocide, killing about 10 billion people - such tools are in the secret laboratories of one of the Five Corporations located on the liner - “NanoCell Corporation”. The protagonist, system engineer of the ship Kate Wilson, was responsible for the safety of the liner - when as a result of an attack by terrorists the ship begins to sink, Kate seeks to survive and tries to prevent the terrorists. What she needs for this, too, is in these secret laboratories. Gameplay One of the creators of the game described the gameplay as a “player against the environment”, meaning, first of all, water - water constantly interacts with everything it comes in contact with, and it gives an incredible variety of situations, sets of options for changing circumstances. Water floods the liner, constantly changing the configuration of spaces suitable for action and movement. The player must constantly adapt to this and respond quickly. Other characters can also affect the situation, and this effect also leads to a redistribution and movement of water. Water may involve other objects and substances in its actions — for example, a gasoline stain that has spread through water may ignite and burn, while water carries these fiery stains throughout the ship. The action can occur both on the surface of the water and in its thickness. HydroEngine, an engine capable of solving this problem with unprecedented realism, was created to simulate flowing water in all its variety for the game.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/92000/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/a01faf72bfaef0a13a0fcf7652453e51-98.jpg

The lands beyond the Forest of Bedegraine are wild, ruled by no one, haunted by the old gods who fought and bled here in times long past. Fallen Champions bridges the gap between King Arthur I and II with a tale of three brave souls. Sir Lionel, a brave knight from Britannia on a quest to rescue a damsel in distress. Lady Corrigan of the Sidhe, a creature of the twilight seeking the secret pathways that could lead her back to her lost home of Tir na nÓg.

Unusual game In the game there are no goals set explicitly and in advance, there are no videos telling anything, there are no monsters with which it is impossible not to fight. Nevertheless, something constantly happens in the game, and what happens in it causes both curiosity and consequences - especially, depending on what you do in the game. For a start, you can go through a very briefing and then step into the world of the game to explore everything by yourself. Unusual setting, unusual gameplay The character of the game is a small man, alone in the whole space of the game. He is surrounded by blocks of different colors. Blocks grow like trees or duckweed on the surface of water. They can even be planted with seeds, just like plants are planted. Each seed after planting in the ""soil"" germinates differently. As a result, you are always surrounded by growing “bushes” or “fields” of blocks that live their own and special lives. It seems that these seeds and blocks speak to you in their own language. Understanding this language and learning how to interact with “plants” is one of the tasks of the game and the condition for success in it. But all this time, another dimension of the game world is slowly destroying the very ground on which you stand. It destroys your world, because everything in it rests on this soil. Clear answers It is noteworthy that everything that happens in the game has its own logic and can ultimately be clarified definitively and definitely. But until that happens, the player may feel ignorant and even confused. Individuality The path to understanding all of this is individual for each player and to a significant degree it is the player who determines what this path will be. The player determines this by his actions, his manner of reacting to what is happening in the game. Goals and story The game still has some goals that the player must achieve. But even the discovery of these goals is based on the fact that the game causes the player curiosity and in the process of satisfying this curiosity the player comes to both understanding the goal and the decision whether to reach this goal or not. There is also a kind of plot, a story in the game. But this story is represented by fragments scattered throughout the game world.

The battlefields of the 31st century are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units known as BattleMechs. Piloting these war machines are the most elite soldiers that the galaxy has ever known. To most, they are known simply as MechWarriors. You will assume the role of an elite MechWarrior, fighting for supremacy over the galaxy against other players.Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.GameplayPiloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/342200/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/3c572df2280fd50a739f2266c61adb8a-98.jpg

The first game in the series, SimCity, was published by Maxis in 1989. The success of SimCity sparked the creation of several sequels and many other spin-off ""Sim"" titles, including 2000's The Sims, which itself became a best-selling computer game and franchise. In the SimCity games, the player develops a city from a patch of undeveloped land. The player controls where to place development zones, infrastructure like roads and power plants, landmarks, and public services such as schools, parks, hospitals and fire stations. The player also determines the tax rate, the budget, and social policy. The city is populated by ""Sims"", simulated persons, who live in the city created by the player. The three development zone types are the major areas in which Sims inhabit: residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones where Sims find work in factories, laboratories and farms. While there is no particular win condition in a game of SimCity, the balancing act of the above mentioned factors provide the constraints which make gameplay possible. To maximize population or profitability, to re-create real life locations in-game, achieve an aesthetic design or to trigger as many natural disasters as possible are among the many possible goals one can determine for oneself while playing a SimCity game. The SimCity universe is loosely based on 20th century California urbanization, and all editions have some common thematic elements: in a new game players start from an undeveloped greenfield, cars are the default form of transportation, and earthquakes happen.",https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/simcity/simcity,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/0acc084e86917864b6de4dbabc707646-98.jpg

This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game. The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and ""planet thrusters""; and there are many such systems in the galaxy.

Knock-knock,knock-knock,57.0,8.3,"Oct 4, 2013","{'Adventure', 'General', 'Miscellaneous'}",,"Knock-Knock is a survival horror game developed by Russian studio Ice-Pick Lodge on Unity. The main difference from most horror games is that the fear factor itself is achieved by using the environment. Sounds, creepy texts, suspense - all of that affects the players. Plot The game's plot is full of unclear moments and allows for multiple interpretations. There is a house in a middle of the forest. It has been used as a lab and a home for three generations of its residents. The Last Resident, just like his ancestors, studies the world around him. One day, the Resident notices that his environment weirdly changes - sounds appear here and there, items get missing. The Resident wants to figure out what's going on. Gameplay The main objective of the game is to help the Resident survive in his house until dawn. This can be achieved by walking around the house and turning the light on in its rooms. Only if the player turns on the light in the room, it becomes possible to interact with the items placed inside that room. Such items are the clock, that can be used to speed up time, or hiding spots. Lighting is an indicator for the appearance of your enemies as it turns off when someone is close to the player. The gameplay is affected by the Resident's bad memory and eyesight. The time in the game is relative. It can pause, pass as usual, or go back. This depends on the player's actions.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/250380/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/04d340c2fe607e6ed472fa1a4e5ababb-98.jpg

Tolkien's fantasy universe, it would have been Guardians of Middle-Earth. This multiplayer-oriented game unites players in teams of up to five to battle against each other on an arena, or to fight an AI-controlled team of the same size. The game offers more than 30 playable characters, mostly from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, including Bilbo, Sauron, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gollum. Their design is based on Peter Jackson's movie series. There are also several characters that don't appear directly in movies or books, such as Arathorn, father of Aragorn. All characters are divided into ""good"" and ""evil"" factions to preserve a semblance of continuity behind the battles, so that Kili wouldn't have to fight Thorin, for example. Treacherous Saruman can join either side. The goal of each team is to destroy the enemy base that is protected not only by the opposing players but also by defense towers. Gameplay in Guardians of Middle-Earth has a distinct ""RTS"" feel to it. Both teams’ bases regularly spawn “minions” who join players in the fight, making the game more about clashes of armies than duels between individual champions.

Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe!The StoryThe year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis.

Plot The protagonist is Cole Anderson, a gruff American ex-Marine, who accompanies a CIA agent on a mission. Their goal is to capture a group of mercenaries who are trying to obtain a biological weapon of mass destruction. The villain, former Russian spy Merinov, is going to sell the weapon to a terrorist organization that plans to provoke a nuclear war. The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines’ jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson’s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov. Gameplay Just like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet’s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There’s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character’s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay.

One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss.

Ultimate General: Gettysburg,ultimate-general-gettysburg,84.0,7.8,"Oct 16, 2014","{'Strategy', 'General', 'Military', 'Real-Time'}",,"Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a Tactical Battle Simulator that allows you to lead thousands of soldiers in the famous Battle of Gettysburg as commander of either the Union or Confederate army. The game features the most accurately created map, complex morale, innovative control mechanics and smart AI. You have the freedom to use different strategies while the battle progresses. Your decisions and military performance play a crucial role in the result. Lead your army and win the Battle of Gettysburg! It has been voted as Best Strategy Game of 2014 by PCGamesN.Main Features Smart AI Commanders Ultimate General: Gettysburg does not use “AI gameplay cheats” because it does not need them. The game’s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills. AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players. Each one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends. The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality. For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battles.What players say: “Fantastic AI - don't know what kind of brain you put in this game but it works”Multi-Day Dynamic Battle On the morning of July 1st 1863, the two armies meet near Gettysburg. Reinforcements arrive from historically accurate directions as the battle progresses, however, random events, delays and tactical differences are always a possibility that can change the results of each engagement compared to history.Can you re-enact Pickett’s Charge? What if Lee attacked the center of the Union Army early in the morning of July 2nd of 1863 instead of attempting to flank the extreme left in the afternoon? What would happen if Meade counter-attacked on July 4th 1863? These questions and more can be answered within the game engine of Ultimate General: Gettysburg.The battle is dynamically fought in time phases and can last up to 4 days. Each day can be separated by up to 3 time phases and the armies’ condition and positioning on the map are saved.According to battle events, you have the possibility to take decisions that can change the tide of the battle based on your prior tactical prowess. For example, when leading the Confederates, on the morning of July 2nd, you can choose to attack at Cemetery Hill and not make a delayed flanking maneuver at Peach Orchard… if you have managed to take Seminary Ridge the previous day! You can even choose to defend and wait for your AI opponent to take the initiative between days. These choices greatly increase the number of possible battle outcomes and challenges.What players say:“9 different AI profiles, multiple outcomes, multiple strategies, casualties carry over. This game is a different experience every time. Well worth it, can't wait for the next one.”Easy Controls & Unit Self-Awareness Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces easily. Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input. Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for “babysitting”. What players say: “Innovative movement system - this is by far an awesome system they developed. It’s not only insanely easy to learn, but also incredibly innovative”Detailed Map of Gettysburg Utilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game. What players say: “Incredible Gorgeous Map - I had to capitalize that because this map is by far one of the best maps of Gettysburg I have ever seen either in a game or even in books”Advanced Line of SightElevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically. Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same to you. The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly. What players say: “The way Game Labs implemented Line of Sight in this game should be held as an example to other developers to do the same”Numerous Tactical Factors In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay. Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue. What players say: “... positioning of units matters. You really bring the struggles of 19th century warfare to life here”Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders Ultimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in between.All brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts. Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated. Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress. What players say: “Immersive American Civil War feel: sounds, portraits and general historical authentic really make this one of the most immersive historical games I have played, and I am a total history buff”Furthermore, every inch of the map has a strategic role. Sloping, terrain type and obstructions affect unit movement realistically. Elevations, ridges and hills provide excellent firing positions and give increased sight, morale and accuracy to troops stationed there.By placing your units close to each other, they become more resilient to charges and flank attacks but get more vulnerable to projectile fire. Thus, forcing your enemy to keep his lines dense while you shell him with artillery can be a valid tactic. As the condition of your units changes dynamically during the battle, the effectiveness of your whole army is affected. For example, units fire more coordinated volleys when they have high morale and have more discipline and tight formations.These and many more deep gameplay mechanics are packed into a simple and intuitive GUI that aims to ease the game experience for the player without overwhelming with complex statistics.Evolving Multiplayer ExperienceThe game currently offers 18 maps for 1vs1 matches and is continuously improved according to user feedback. What players say: “Well, actually, the AI in this game is about the best ever seen (except for chess), and there is a working multiplayer with about always at least one battle going.”Ultimate General: Gettysburg is developed by Game Labs and designed by Nick Thomadis, known for his successful and popular “DarthMod” series.How to Play Please read our guide",http://store.steampowered.com/app/306660/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/ca1b7794359904960aa417e5db842899-98.jpg

Its campaigns are based on alternate history concepts. Plot The game is set in the Cold War era. Wargame: Red Dragon follows a series of fictional yet plausible conflicts between the various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the campaign mode, its timeline covers the 1970s, 1980s, and up until 1996. The player controls various factions, both from Eastern and Western bloc. The story campaign includes a civil war in Korea, a Chinese invasion of the Russian Far East, a conflict over British-occupied Hong Kong, a Kuril islands border conflict, and a Soviet invasion of Korea. Gameplay The player controls his or her units from a top-down view in the real time. At each level, the player and his or her opponent, whether AI or the other human player, start at the different sides of a map and fight to control it. Being a wargame by definition, Wargame: Red Dragon doesn't have much of economic element. The player deploys the already existing units rather than creates them. To receive reinforcements during the battle, the player has to capture and hold specific parts of the map that serve as deployment zones. Besides the campaign mode, the game offers its players to choose from more than twenty nations, and additional nations are available through DLC. Wargame: Red Dragon also has a competitive multiplayer mode.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/251060/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/8ec126776b301190a763df6ef7744367-98.jpg

The studio specializes on Sherlock Holmes games. 'Crimes and Punishments' is six out of seven games in the series. Gameplay The player takes a role of Sherlock Holmes — famous detective. The game consists of 6 non-related cases. The first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. Story Three out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. Features One of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant.

The player has to build the walls and towers, hire the knights and archers, and establish a productive medieval economy to support the war effort. Most missions involve a siege of a castle, with the player as the attacker, the defender, or both. Economy Everything in Stronghold, from the food to the war, requires the player to establish a chain of production, such as a mill and a bakery to make bread. The player has to produce armor and weapons before hiring most types of units. There's also a reputation meter that tracks what the people think of their lord. The player can increase his or her reputation by offering the people more food, lowering taxes, or building pubs and churches. Multiplayer Stronghold Crusader II has several multiplayer modes.

It's less about action and strategy and more about taking an emotional and philosophical journey that allows the player to explore his or her own sense of mortality. You will be very, very confused along the way, but your interpretation of this confusion is what the game is all about. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not looking for something very weird and different. Continue? is for the type of person that appreciates odd, poetic word play, interpretation of the abstract, and existential philosophy.Some games we play to kill time on a long commute, some we play at home to blow off steam after a hard day’s work, and some games are about escaping into a world more magical than our own. Continue? is meant to be played late at night with some wine or weed, when you're feeling quiet and contemplative.Everything in Continue? has a deeper meaning behind it. All of the strange places you go to, people you talk to, and scenarios you go through are part of a greater idea that I hope you spend a second or two trying to figure out and interpret...or not. You can also just play the damn thing.What happens to dead video game characters?In the garbage dump of the Random Access Memory, you travel from town to town, meeting people who offer you their lightning and their prayer. Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which affects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.Each game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.DevelopmentContinue? was inspired by existential road trips into nowhere, Peruvian jungle drugs, and a brush with death while lost in the mountains of New Mexico. It is a quest for wonder, contemplation, and peace. By:Continue?9876543210 was independently developed by Jason Oda in 2013.

She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison's staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages. Gameplay Unlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania.

The Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman's Detective Vision. When Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him.

In the game, you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this. Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example, a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts, who were once people and killed - after talking with them, you can learn about the circumstances of this.

It's 1991, and things are bad. You're a guy with a house and family. Other players are coming to take what's yours. Build security to stop them. Study their houses, buy tools, and break in to take what's theirs. Everything you do is permanent.I'm Jason Rohrer, and The Castle Doctrine is my 10th game. It's a bit hard to describe, because there's never been anything quite like it before. It's a brutal game in terms of its perma-death and perma-destruction consequences, and it is turn-based, so it's rather Rogue-like. But building such a brutal game in a multiplayer context, with absolutely no cushion between players to stop them from brutalizing each other, is quite strange and new. Everything is real in this game. When you rob someone, you are actually hurting another player in a permanent way by destroying and stealing their hard work. When someone dies in this game, they lose everything and start over. If you devise perplexing security systems, you can perma-death other players when they come to rob you. Watching those security tapes, where someone gets what's coming to them, is an exhilarating experience. On the other hand, you just killed someone and perhaps caused them to lose days of their hard work. And you've been on the other side too, losing everything because of some thoughtless move you made in someone else's house.But there is no randomness in this game, so everything is fair. When you die, it is always your fault. When things get dicey, you can always retreat back out the front door to save your own neck. Of course, human folly will get the better of you.Here's what you get when you buy the game:A lifetime account on the central world server that I'm running.Access to the full game source code (after launching the game on Steam, go here).Everything you need to run your own game server (requires a PHP/MySQL web server, download the source bundle to get started).",http://store.steampowered.com/app/249570/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/96d96e8d82b99656b068e60bec275e6e-98.jpg

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2,castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2,58.0,7.7,"Feb 25, 2014","{'General', 'Action Adventure', 'Fantasy'}",M,"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure and a straight continuation of the first part of the franchise. It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors. Gameplay The game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies. Story The game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures. DLC The Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: ""Dark Dracula"" and ""Armored Dracula"" bring only new characters skins and sprites.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/239250/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/55ccc5d311a453bcde32c69eda853140-98.jpg
Sacred 3,sacred-3,57.0,1.5,"Jul 31, 2014","{'Action RPG', 'Role-Playing'}",M,"Sacred 3 is a hack’n’slash game, a third installment in the series. Plot The game starts with a brief introduction to the fantasy world of Ancaria. The realm prospered for a long time, until the ruler of the Ashen Kingdom struck a deal with demons, and invaded his neighbors. The player must take action as one of the six playable characters, each with different classes and abilities, and save the world. Gameplay The third game of the series has shifted from being an RPG diablo-like game to an arcade slasher, removing skill trees and development, while adding even more enemies, dynamic action and refined physics. Each level in the campaign shares similarities with one another, as the objectives are simple: defeat enemies, reach the checkpoint, defeat the boss and unlock the next level. Graphics and other features The game is rich with fantasy characters, colorful landscapes and well-designed enemies. The special effects in battle provide the player with an arcade touch: blood splatters from every foe, mysterious explosions occur to left and right, ground quakes from fearsome bosses. The game features a 4-player cooperative mode, where players take up arms as different heroes and join in battles against hordes of enemies.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/247950/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/b1827358187a10205a17c41fb1ccc912-98.jpg

Back to Bed,back-to-bed,57.0,5.8,"Aug 6, 2014","{'General', 'Action'}",,Back to bed is an indie surreal puzzle game developed by Bedtime Digital Games. The game was initially developed as a student project for DADIU. The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter. The player's objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player. The game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There's also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker's outfit or simply the typography of the game.,http://store.steampowered.com/app/308040/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/007faf66cff2a601188cef0d008b37cc-98.jpg

Infinity Runner,infinity-runner,56.0,6.5,"Jul 14, 2014","{'General', 'Action'}",,"The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind; flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars. However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 & DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player. In Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. Even though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship. The Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. There is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre! FEATURES * WEREWOLVES IN SPACE! * 14 ACTION PACKED LEVELS * ARCADE MODE * STORY-MODE * OCULUS RIFT MODE (DK1 - DK2 Runtime 4.4) * WOLF LEVELLING SYSTEM * MULTI-PLAYER MODE WITH UP TO 32 PLAYERS STARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION Over 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/279920/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/256df690a1bfa3277c748c3081ef89db-98.jpg

The Age of Decadence,the-age-of-decadence,81.0,8.0,"Oct 15, 2015","{'PC-style RPG', 'Western-Style', 'Role-Playing'}",,"The Age of Decadence, our first but hopefully not the last RPG, is now available. If you've been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you've just discovered it, ""stay awhile and listen"". The most commonly asked question is:What Kind of Game Is It?It’s a very different game than anything you’ve ever played. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn’t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn’t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path – Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass – such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule. The Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn’t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won’t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design. So What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games?1. The SetupTraditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three's game critic):""But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That’s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended.""The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain.You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats.2. Combat difficultyAnother design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It’s a hard game. Combat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can’t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights.You aren’t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we’re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you’re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you’ll end up dead before you can blink.3. Choices & ConsequencesChoices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you'll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable.Starting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin.The questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default. You will have to play the game several times to better understand what’s going on, piece everything together, and see the full effect of the choices you make.The Big Question: Should You Buy The Game?Try before you buy. Even if everything I said sounds exactly like your kind of game, try the demo first. That’s what it’s there for. It gives you access to the first Chapter, consisting of 3 locations and about 30 quests split between mutually exclusive questlines and decisions.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/230070/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/fc6ec3c50f4ca5f96a650369391c380c-98.jpg

On the one hand, this is unusual - but on the other, it makes it possible to create anything if you become a programmer. You do not need to become a programmer to play this game - the world consisting of bits, this is only part of the plot of the game. And the game itself is intended for everyone, including those who do not have programming skills at all. A boring character in a boring city The character controlled by the player is called Sebastian. He arrives in the city of Dorisburg. He was offered a job there - not a programmer, but only a seller at Wellspring. The city is unfamiliar to Sebastian, he has no acquaintances there. Sebastian (that is, you as a player), until there is nothing left but to wander, explore the city, study duties at work and live quite ordinary life, go to a bar in the evenings, attend parties, make friends and hardly wake up to walk to work. Knock, knock, Sebastian Events get a significant acceleration when Sebastian meets a girl named Pixie. The main story of the game begins with this acquaintance. By the way, both the tempo of the story and its specific turns depend on what you decide (along with Sebastian). Everything can be stretched in time or, on the contrary, it can be carried at full speed, and where it goes - there is more than one option. Pixie girl tells (and shows) Sebastian that their world is a world controlled by coding and programming. True, not everyone knows this, and all the more, not everyone is allowed to use this knowledge for actions on their own. But where there are programmers, there are hackers. Moreover, the temptation is so great - to turn a trolley bus into a personal supercar, for example. How to say it in Sprak Sebastian acquires a gadget called modifyer - it shows the code of any object in the game. The codes are written in the Sprak language, which is very similar to Basic. The ease of transforming the world encourages Sebastian to try more and more different things. Errors are inevitable on this path - and it is difficult not to notice them, because try not to notice how you incorrectly programmed the skyscraper! By the way, the Sprak language is in itself a source of pleasant puzzles, having more than one solution for each puzzle. And the matter is not so much in the capabilities of the language, as in your capabilities - after all, you can find a variety of solutions for the same problem. For example, instead of “writing” a high-speed car for yourself, you can “write” a passage to the right place - even if it is separated from your “reality” for many kilometers.

The gameplay is a metaphorical representation of a visual programming language. The protagonist represents the processor register, and the player's instructions to the character stand in for the opcodes. Premise The main character is an office clerk who works in a storage department. His career lasts 40 years, each of them corresponding to an in-game puzzle. Two conveyor belts in the protagonist's office work as the input and the output devices, respectively. The input conveyor brings in the numbers and letters in the form of boxes. The protagonist is instructed to perform certain tasks and calculations with the boxes before sending them back through the output conveyor. The tasks usually require simple mathematical actions such as sorting and addition. The boxes remain stored on the office floor until the task is completed. Gameplay The player controls the character using commands that remind the assembly language. The handwritten notes represent the instructions the player gives to the character. As the player progresses through the puzzles, the game introduces more complicated concepts and mechanics, such as memory addresses. This feature allows the player to order the character to perform operations in the certain place of the office. The goal of each level is to create a program.

Pathologic Classic HD,pathologic-classic-hd,76.0,8.5,"Oct 29, 2015","{'3D', 'First-Person', 'Adventure'}",,"The original Indie Cult Classic returns fully restored, and more evocative than ever. Pathologic Classic HD is the Definitive Edition of the original Cult Classic Psychological First-Person Survival game. The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past. On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three ""heroes."" Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town. Brand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it. Brand New Voice-overs. New content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restored Updated textures and higher resolutions support. New visual effects.Newly Included Fan-Made Polish translation: thanks to the hard work and generosity of Jakub Derdziak & Aldona Derdziak. An Italian translation, kindly donated to us by the original translators of the game, Stefano Gaburri and Claudio Todeschini. An indie cult classic. 12 days in a plague-ridden town. Time is running, and mostly it’s running out; numerous events unfold, whether you’re there to witness them or not. 70+ hours of real-time gameplay without grinding or repetitive quests. As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events. 3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelor’s, the Haruspex’s, and the Changeling’s plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots. The plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. It’s not just about the fate of the dying town—it’s about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are. An open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story. Survival is tough. The dying town demands that you constantly keep an eye on your status, maintaining a full belly and decent immunity. That will require tough choices. Communicate, barter, rob, or steal. There are many ways to acquire your bare necessities, each of them with its own benefits and drawbacks. The atmosphere of bleakness and despair without cartoonish evil or bad guys.

The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians,the-fall-of-the-dungeon-guardians,71.0,6.9,"Nov 6, 2015","{'Western-Style', 'Role-Playing'}",,"Introduction :The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an RPG Dungeon Crawler game, in First Person View, inspired by classics like Dungeon Master™ and Might & Magic®, but featuring a modern tactical combat based on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism coupled with the threat & aggro system and an active pause. Story :You’re a newly employed guard of a prison deep inside a dungeon. The night of your arrival, strange things happen and when you wake up in the morning, all prisoners have escaped amidst chaos. The warden wisely decides to leave the dungeon as quickly as possible, while tasking you to run after the escaping prisoners. You then assemble your team and venture into the mysterious dungeon. A Call For Adventure :Enter a big, massive dungeon, full of danger, mystery and secrets.Fight your way through hordes of enemies and powerful creatures.Explore intricate corridors, underground palaces, mines fallen into oblivion and evil crypts.Solve puzzles, avoid deadly traps, uncover hidden passages, and keep your bearing through mazes & hallways. Character Building :You’ll take command of a party of 4 guardians. Each guardian comes with a set of spells & abilities, with new ones appearing over the course of the adventure.For each new level reached, the guardians get a point to use in their talent trees, allowing them to reinforce their abilities or gain new powers.There are 4 classes to choose from: the warrior, the healer, the mage & the rogue. Each class has 3 specializations represented by a talent tree, and each specialization comes with its own set of abilities. So you have 12 base build-ups. In addition, your guardians can choose freely to spend their talent points in any of the 3 specializations of their class, allowing for even more varied set-ups.The dungeon is filled with loot: epic armors, legendary weapons and mystical, magical items. Often when you kill a group of enemies, they’ll drop a random piece of equipment that one of your guardians can use, raising more and more of their powers. Evolved Combat System :The combat is focused on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism, coupled with an exciting threat mechanism: your healer’s spells directly threaten all the enemies nearby, and thus your tank must use his abilities to attract their wrath and protect the healer. The tank must then be able to mitigate a lot of the enemy damage using his defensive skills.Your last 2 guardians will be the damage dealers, trying to kill the enemies as fast as possible, while they’re busy with the tank.All guardians get a lot of abilities and not only will using the right one at the right moment be essential to your party’s survival, but also combining different abilities in sequence to maximize their efficiency will be required to vanquish your strongest foes.It sounds like a lot, but fortunately the game comes with an active pause: you can pause the game whenever you feel like it, check everything, queue the next abilities for your guardians, and then resume the game.You don’t like tanks, or you don’t like pausing the game? No problem, just lower the game difficulty, and you’ll be able to play without a real tank or pausing. You can precisely tune the difficulty at any time during your exploration.Unlike old-school FPV Dungeon Crawlers, you don’t have to strafe-turn-strafe-turn all the time in Dungeon Guardians. Your tank comes with serious defensive skills (armor, dodge & parry) that let him handle most of the enemy attacks, as long as the healer backs him up.

Asymmetrical co-op allows one player to take the role of the spy while a friend provides overwatch and assistance as the hacker, and unravel a post-Cold War espionage conspiracy.The year is 1996, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A string of accidents and murders gone mostly unnoticed by the public eye have put the world of international espionage on high alert - veteran Cold War operatives from both sides of the former Iron Curtain are being assassinated around the globe. High-ranking officials of the CIA and the FSB secretly establish a joint task force to investigate the leaks. Codenamed The Kingbridge Executive, the group is funded with whatever money could be skimmed off of official projects and staffed by whoever could be spared from official operations. As field operative Katya Kozlova or hacker Martin Symborski, you will be deployed on dangerous missions across Europe and North America, chasing the source of the leaks.Key FeaturesSingle Player & Asymmetrical co-op: Play as the spy while a friend guides you through the missions or take on the role of the hacker to crack infrastructure and defeat security systems.A return to hard-core stealth games where the enemies are lethal and combat is unforgiving.A deep hacking system built around core stealth game mechanics, rife with options to manipulate the game world and mess with your enemies.Use social engineering in cooperative dialogue sequences to bypass security checkpoints and gain entry to restricted areas.Your actions won't go unnoticed - the story will respond to how much evidence you leave in each mission and how many dead bodies you leave in your wake.Playing as the SpyThe role of the Spy will be familiar to fans of stealth/action games. As the Spy, you will experience Clandestine as a 3rd person game, controlling the movements and actions of Katya in the game world. Katya is the boots on the ground, armed with weapons and gadgets that you can use to stay alive and evade your opponents. Katya is also well trained in hand-to-hand combat, and can use lethal or non-lethal stealth takedowns to take down enemies, leaving behind as little evidence as possible. During the mission, it also falls to the Spy to search for dossiers and intel to unlock new equipment and software for subsequent missions.Playing as the HackerMartin operates in an entirely different way than the spy, which is reflected in the hacker player's interface and game mechanics. As the Hacker, players have access to four game windows and a toolbar. These game windows are: the Camera Feed, the Console, the Network View, and the Tactical Map.Camera FeedThe Camera Feed allows the hacker to observe the game world and scout ahead for the Spy. By default, the Camera Feed displays the Operative Camera (a hidden camera worn by Katya), but you can also jump into surveillance cameras on the Tactical Map (see below) to look through them and scout the levels for enemies and other threats. The Camera Feed also displays the status of the Spy's health.ConsoleThe Console always displays game Objectives at the top of the window and prints important information in the Message Log such as cracked keypad codes. You can also use it to communicate with the Spy via the in-game text chat.Network ViewThe Network View window is where Hackers can access the computer network(s) which run all of the electronic infrastructure in the mission area. This includes door keypads, PCs, Servers, Firewalls, and Hazards (steam pipes and electrical boxes which can be triggered to cause ""accidents""). Hackers must be mindful of the Network Admin, an enemy AI which searches for changes in the Network and tries to correct them. Not only will the Admin kick a hacker from the Network if caught, the Admin will also reset firewalls and pass-codes. Hackers can unlock Viruses and DDOS attacks to keep the Admin busy when trying to escape or complete an objective.Tactical MapThe Tactical Map is the window Hackers use to provide direct support to their Spy partners. This includes gaining access to cameras for scouting and observation, tagging enemies so the spy can track their location without maintaining line-of-sight, and use Local Assets to drop ammo or health, ""clean up"" bodies, cancel alarms before they sound, and even bribe enemies.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/290530/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/5da2bebafdeba718000dba137e2a41de-98.jpg

It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter. Uncanny Valley features dark, claustrophobic levels and is set to creepy horror synth / dark ambient music.

The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings. The protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom's love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character's illusions and dreams. Gameplay The player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman's job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets.

Thanks to the money from their families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup happened, theaters and museums were closed.

It is one of the most popular turn-based strategies ever created. Plot The game takes place in the fantasy world of Enroth. The story mode follows a large-scale war for the country of Erathia. Its queen Catherine defends her homeland from invading dark forces. The game's seven campaigns allow the player to participate in this war on various sides. Gameplay AI and human players take turns, each turn representing an in-game day. Each player controls cities, heroes, and units. The default victory condition is to eliminate rival players by capturing their cities. The story mode, though, has missions with specific plot-related conditions. There are eight types of cities. Each type has a set of units and a unique style, based on a fantasy culture such as elves, orcs, demons or the undead. Any player can conquer and control any city. A player who loses all his or her cities is eliminated. A hero leads an army of units. Heroes explore the map, capture resources, fight enemies and neutral monsters. As they gain experience, heroes level up and obtain new skills and spells. Each hero has eight unit slots. Units of the same type stack and act as a single, stronger unit. During combat, units take turns on a hexagonal grid. HD Edition A new edition, released in 2015, includes slightly improved graphics redesigned for modern monitors and tablets. Otherwise, the game is identical to its original version.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/297000/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/5901d084437ec98403075d045e6682a5-98.jpg

Some elements in the surroundings change when the player turns away or leaves, and become more than just a direction sign: they become the way along which the player walks, flies and falls. Finding such a way to the higher levels is a matter of his aptness and intuition, rewarded by advancing higher. Failure, on the other hand, brings a return to the lower levels, which may be more or less altered then.StoryIf you fall asleep while stargazing, a gate to a new world situated in between the world of memories and the world of dreams will open for you. That intermediate world gradually turns reality to fragments and infuses the player with the desire to know the unknowable. But the most persistent can feel the unknowable.“You count the stars above your head just like the one who pointed a finger at you from the unknown.

Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago. The story and setting Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar. Continuous support The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/overwatch-legendary-edition-switch/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/5b4b131363a4dba40e923bb8f788d56e-98.jpg

Tyranny is a spiritual successor to Pillars of Eternity and uses the same graphics engine and gameplay model. Plot The game is set in a medieval world called Terratus that was almost completely conquered by Kyros, an immortal evil overlord. No one has ever seen Kyros, but he spent four centuries uniting all the realms under his reign. Kyros rules through his powerful viceroys, the Archons, who, in turn, command their minions called Fatebinders. The protagonist is one of Fatebinders at Kyros' service. He or she is sent to the Tiers province that is torn by the conflict. Two of the Kyros' armies fight each other, and it slows down the conquest. The protagonist has to stop the conflict or to be executed. Gameplay The player has to create the main character from scratch and define his or her abilities. The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character's background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character's abilities and the companions the player can recruit. Like in Pillars of Eternity, the player has to make difficult decisions that strongly influence the plot and the lives of NPCs.

Ghost 1.0,ghost-10,80.0,7.4,"Jun 7, 2016","{'Open-World', 'Action Adventure'}",,"""Ghost"" is a metroidvania where two super hackers hire a mysterious agent in order to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal the greatest electronic secret ever. Of course, the space station will defend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, with their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to be destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find out about their agent's hidden ties... WEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No need to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses. GHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body. UPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are. ITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls. GEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden ""geekies"". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny. SECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special. MAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss. STORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English. GAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: ""classic"" and ""survival"". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die. SKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way. And the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/463270/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/84f56cf007fe7fc375daf8388dd7fdfe-98.jpg

Hue,hue,79.0,7.4,"Aug 30, 2016","{'Action', 'Puzzle'}",,"In a one-color world, one scholar, working in one of the universities, suddenly discovers the phenomenon of color. But where she works, nobody needs her discovery. And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum. The player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors. Game mechanics based on color In the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game's background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, ""open"" some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated. There are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning. The Mysteries of the Final In addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/383270/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/d782119f10dd43155def1a53f6d44f98-98.jpg

As they draw near, it fades into the fog like a mirage, leaving only questions for all who have borne witness to this “Castle Strangerock.”An up-and-coming scholar named Charlotte L. Wells has had her interest piqued by this local legend and desperately wishes to study it in person—but of course, Harlech Island is no place for an unescorted young lady. To aid her in her investigation, therefore, she enlists the help of an old childhood friend and fallen knight who agrees to accompany her on this adventure.Arriving in Harlech and catching sight of Castle Strangerock almost immediately, Char dives into researching the mystery head-on, leaving her companion to explore the surrounding environs on his own in search of any artifacts that might help trace the origins of this ephemeral stronghold.Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure. Xanadu Next is an exploration-centric action RPG from Nihon Falcom, the acclaimed creators of the Ys and The Legend of Heroes RPG franchises. A late entry in their immensely popular Dragon Slayer series and a spiritual follow-up to the late ‘80s cult classic Faxanadu, Xanadu Next puts players in the shoes of a gravely injured knight given a new lease on life through ancient magic who must now seek a legendary sword called “Dragon Slayer” to ensure his survival.Players will fight hordes of monsters in real time while exploring the lush, mysterious and perilous environments of Harlech Island, along with the ruins of an ancient paradise known as Xanadu that was partially inspired by tales of the Mongolian emperor Kublai Khan. Along the way, players will uncover bits and pieces of Xanadu’s past in the form of ancient stone tablets and memorandums, piecing together a complex tale of magic, war, an ancient dragon, and a mysterious figure known only as the “Black Bride.”FeaturesAn Interconnected World Full of SecretsIcy peaks connect with fiery caverns, old waterways, mystical forests and magical ruins, creating one single giant map to explore with countless secret passageways, alternate routes, shortcuts, hidden items, deadly bosses and new techniques to uncover.Real-Time Combat with Dozens of Unique AbilitiesFight ruthless enemies in real time, using a wide variety of skills to aid you. As in Ys SEVEN, skills are attached to weapons and can be learned through repeated use of those weapons, adding an element of excitement and promise to every new armament found.Exploration Rewarded with Rich BackstoryStone tablets and old letters are scattered throughout the ruins on Harlech Island, each written in an ancient tongue. Fortunately, your companion is an accomplished scholar who can translate them for you in real time, providing valuable insight into important events and mythologies from the age of Xanadu.Unique Gameplay Systems that Keep the Experience FreshPlayers can choose to level-down in order to tweak their stats, fuse themselves with “Guardians” to gain new passive abilities, learn spells, and even carve keys from monster bones to lessen demand for pre-made keys and keep their prices low.Atmospheric Visuals and Music in Classic Falcom TraditionInspired by hardcore dungeon RPGs of the '80s and created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Xanadu, one of Japan's action RPG forefathers, Xanadu Next mimics the gritty, medieval look of its ancestor, but in full 3D and with ample amounts of subtle detailing, as well as a foreboding and wholly unique soundtrack composed by Falcom's venerable Sound Team jdk.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/312560/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/667f38b04c7e072423d4637515f58df6-98.jpg

Gameplay The game mixes resource mining and construction used in real-time strategies with a stronger economic element. The player has to choose a company he or she will control. The other three companies become the player's rivals. They seldom fight outright, and their rivalry is largely economic. However, they can secretly organize acts of sabotage against each other, eliminate resources with underground nukes and hire goons to attack or defend. The main goal of the game is to assume control over all four companies by purchasing their majority stakes and to create a monopoly. If a rival company obtains the majority in the player's corporation, he or she loses the game. Resources The game puts a strong emphasis on mining and trading resources. Each level starts with the player scanning the surface of Mars to find resources and build his or her headquarters next to them. Offworld Trading Company has thirteen types of resources. Most of the resources, such as iron, aluminum, and water, can be mined from the Martian soil. Some, like steel, food, and chemicals, are produced from other resources and require special buildings.

The Earth's surface froze over, and humans were forced to live underwater -- where they could still harvest energy and grow food -- changing how cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971, sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable planets. Things did not go as planned. And now the ship, Argo9, has returned thousands of years later in a time after humans have gone extinct.It's up to you to determine whether the ruins of our species is a travesty or an inevitable conclusion as you explore the lush aquatic world and encounter deadly underwater monsters.The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human || Digital DELUXE Edition This edition includes a pixel art map with all the boss locations, the full soundtrack composed by Karl Flodin -- and a digital booklet that gives some extra information about the story, weapons, and upgrades.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION? The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES? There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination. MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES This is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics. FACTS & FIGURES 179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release. FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS? You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there. More than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them. A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE) We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal. OUR DLC POLICY We are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics. The game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics). ONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline. AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS The game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/369990/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/9b72d3793603e2e5e52cabf672a8c691-98.jpg

Corpse Party,corpse-party,71.0,7.5,"Apr 25, 2016","{'Survival', 'Action Adventure'}",,"Kisaragi Academy student Mayu Suzumoto is transferring to a new high school, leaving behind a sizable group of friends and countless lovely memories. To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them. Corpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.KEY FEATURESHighly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere Modeled after the very first RPG Maker Corpse Party, the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display. Adventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference Playing like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, Corpse Party gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do. Chapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content The tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, recreated with added content in classic Corpse Party adventure style. Original Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature Over 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze. The Game That Started It All When first released in 2008, this title sparked a Corpse Party boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless Corpse Party-inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style.

Bohemian Killing,bohemian-killing,55.0,5.9,"Jul 21, 2016","{'Visual Novel', 'Adventure'}",,"Steampunk Paris, set against the background of the late 19th century, torn between tradition and modernity. Class differences and pervasive racism finally lead to a tragedy. A year later you find yourself on trial, accused of a brutal murder. How far will you go to exonerate yourself? Will you lie, seek evidence to prop your testimony or, perhaps, pretend to be insane? Your imagination is the limit. OVERVIEWBohemian Killing is a narrative-driven courtroom drama, offering players almost unlimited possibilities of solving the lawsuit, thanks to the complete integration of gameplay and narrated story. It is also the first law-themed game made by a real-life lawyer!STORYLINEWelcome to Paris of the late 19th century. The aftermath of the Great Revolution offered a new start for each and every citizen, regardless of social class. Alfred Ethon, a young inventor of Gypsy origin, benefits from the change, becoming a symbol of success thanks to his hard work and innovative projects, well ahead of their time.Soon, a young woman is brutally murdered - a maid working for an impoverished Lord, a relic of the old French regime. Is Alfred Ethon to be blamed for the murder? The evidence points towards him... But you can change that.As you stand before the court, all you can count on is your own intellect and creativity. But how does that look in practice?GAMEPLAYGameplay in Bohemian Killing is a combination of a courtroom drama, and a walking simulator. It can be classified as a first person experience, or a first person interactive story adventure game.The story is set within two time frames. In the present, you find yourself locked up in the courtroom. You're getting acquainted with the evidence, witness testimony and questions posed by the Judge. Each question triggers a flashback - and begins your testimony. During the flashback you find yourself in a Parisian district, with each of your decisions, interactions and action affecting Alfred Ethons' testimony and the final verdict.To help you in your testimony, you'll have access to all the evidence gathered on the case - expert opinions, reports and witness testimonies. Each of them can be (but doesn't have to be!) refuted in a number of different ways.In the Evidence menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories, making them easy to find.Sample:A neighbor testified that at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house, noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so. Or maybe you'll get into a bar fight just a few minutes before, so that you can testify that the blood the neighbor saw was yours, and not the victim's? Or maybe you will cut yourself while shaving, covering your clothes with blood that the neighbor sees later? But what if the court finds your time of shaving conspicuous and torments you with even more questions? How will you get out of this?With a wide range of possibilities that can lead to several standard endings and one additional hidden one, the game doesn't consider any path ""a bad one"", ensuring that each playthrough will be different.To adjust the game to the preferences of each player, two modes are available:In the Standard mode, the outcome depends entirely on your creativity and ability to solve logical problems. You will suffer the consequences of your own actions.In the Story mode, your attorney will advise you as you progress along, commenting on your decisions and choices, preventing you from acting in a way that might prove to be harmful in the eyes of the court. VOICE ACTINGThe main character of the game is played and dubbed by a world-class film and voice actor, Stephane Cornicard!Stephane Cornicard studied in France, at the prestigious Colby College in the US, and at Goldsmith College in the UK. He played in numerous blockbusters such as “Spectre,” the most recent Bond film, or Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan”.His career as a voice actor is no less impressive and includes Syphon Filter, Primal, Metal Gear Solid, and the Dragon Age and Total War series.

His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason.

Pin down your opponent's infantry to gain the advantage and force a retreat, or push through with a perfectly executed plan.Real-world Setting:Using the latest version of Eugen’s IRISZOOM engine, players can smoothly zoom from a tactical aerial view all the way down to a single unit, and see 400 different real-world vehicles and units designed with careful historical detail and accuracy. Maps are designed based on actual aerial reconnaissance photos of Normandy in 1944, requiring real-world tactics and strategies to cover and control.Outplan, Outsmart, Outgun:From battlegroup customization to troop positioning and maneuvering, winning battles requires cunning and strategy, not just raw firepower. Each unit lost presents a growing tactical disadvantage, and players will need to fight to gain -- and keep -- the upper hand.From commanding historically accurate infantry, tanks, and vehicles, to troop positioning and real-time engagement with the enemy, players will need to be clever and resourceful in order to win. Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory. Whether viewing the entire battle from an aerial perspective, or following a single tank into a firefight, players will need to cleverly manage the dynamic front line in order to execute ambushes and advances.",http://store.steampowered.com/app/572410/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/52ae993fb03ed372e1d8aeb242724e64-98.jpg

You can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries. Plort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics. Slimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes. To get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important. Gameplay and economics Slimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves. It is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources. From different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water. Slimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode. Some slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment. Ordinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime. Game modes Adventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. Carefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier. The five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.

It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.

Shadows of Adam brings a compelling story, unique fast-paced battle system and modernized visuals to a beloved genre. Tucked away from the outside world by the impenetrable haze of the Misty Woods, the village of Adam has mostly lived in peace since the days of the Wraith War. Magic, the dark power that fueled that war has vanished. But darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary hero, Orazio, is no more. 10 years ago he left without explanation and never returned, leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark secret he left behind—a secret that must now be revealed if the children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though its revelation could unhinge the world. Compelling Character Driven Story: Shadows of Adam’s story is one with deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon. A Strategic AP Management Battle System: AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat. Beautiful Visuals: Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the SNES-era. Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks: An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that’s inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melody and emotional connection. It’s an honor for us to provide Shadows of Adam in its entirety to newcomers, and of course to our tens of thousands of Kickstarter supporters, followers and fans finally getting their full course meal! This game is our tribute to an industry which has consistently rewarded its followers for decades by offering classic after classic to keep even the strongest and most unique RPG urges satiated. While gameplay formulas and graphics have steadily raised standards across many genres over the years, even making older games in some genres downright unplayable, JRPG classics remain timeless, because of a secret all JRPG fans should know too well. It isn’t necessarily about the gameplay and graphics that go into the game, but rather the HEART and SOUL poured into it which goes on to beat through each heartwarming moment and pulse through every gut-wrenching ride. While Shadows Of Adam does boast spiffy new graphics, and awesome new gameplay, we at Something Classic know just how important that heart and soul bit really is. That’s why we poured every inch of our heart and soul into this game -down to the very last red pixel!- and you can bet that our thousands of fans and hundreds of testers have put in equal effort towards making this game not only a reality, but also a success!

Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions.

ARK: Survival Evolved,ark-survival-evolved,70.0,5.6,"Aug 29, 2017","{'Survival', 'Action Adventure', 'Sandbox'}",T,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.

Formula Fusion,formula-fusion,58.0,7.5,"Jun 1, 2017","{'Racing', 'Futuristic', 'Arcade'}",,"Formula Fusion is an anti-gravity racing game which pits your racing pedigree up against the rest of the world. Tackle the single player campaign and become the best pilot against the AI over leagues and championships, or play against the world in multiplayer and compete in a sports league where you can take either yourself or your team to the top step. Track Technology Tracks are made up of magnetic superconductors that suspend the craft within a gravitational field using super-cells, cooled by liquid nitrogen. This Quantum Levitation effect allows the craft to skim along the track at incredibly high speeds whilst remaining suspended above the track surface. Magnetic side buffers create an invisible barrier to dampen impact at high speeds whilst holographic digital elements serve to update your HUD with visual feedback. Weapon Technology You are able to research new technology to add to craft weapon slots, which you can activate during race-time. Weapons and counter-measures in Formula Fusion are all digital. Once you use one you will need to re-charge them to reactivate them again. This will allow the player to choose to be either aggressive or defensive and as you progress through the craft stages more slots will be made available. Handling and Features With enhancements to the traditional way of AG craft handling we have developed our own hybrid, a mixture of physics and spline control. In addition to the craft technology we have developed, we will create a garage system that allows you to fine tune your craft to your own specification. Tracks will be designed with many track themes and dynamic track surfaces. Track features will include corkscrews, twists, banks, jumps, and more. Gameplay Gameplay includes a layer of technology research and craft customization through the team garage facility, along with competitive ‘edge of your seat’ style racing in the various classes working your way from FF4000 Racing Class through to the aerodynamic FX1000 Hyper Sports leagues. Along with the base game modes we also aim to bring you visceral ‘in-cockpit’ F1 style action and synchronous eSports Racing Leagues. The game will have features such as ghost mode, collaborative F1 style team play, races, and leagues. Motivation The game represents not only a next generation reboot of the classic AG Racing genre, but also a drive to bring back the core tried and tested elements from the most successful and most cherished AG Racing titles ever made including a thumping soundtrack, The Designers Republic inspired art, fast paced gameplay, fun tracks, and addictive gameplay. Game Setting The game is set in and around New York State 50 years after the cataclysmic events of an all-out global nuclear war rendering most areas uninhabitable. Redevelopment on a vast scale has all but papered over the cracks, with many districts almost unrecognisable. The division between rich and poor is the greatest it has ever been with Favela style slums and make-shift buildings forming poverty stricken rings around affluent commercial districts. The year is 2075. 177 years since man first got behind the wheel of a car and raced against a competitor. Through the years, advances in science and technology have pushed the field of Quantum Levitation to a degree that allows modern transportation to be suspended within artificially created gravity fields above magnetic super-conducted highways. Along with transportation, this technology became embedded in motor sport racing; the pomp and celebration of what was Formula 1, evolved to become FORMULA FUSION – QUANTUM RACING LEAGUES. The racing calendar is now established as a global sporting event that brings technology and science together like never before. Because of the high level of technical competition and the huge levels of investment the race attracts - the traditional corporate backed race teams have given way to huge University based research facilities, and each team is now represented on a national level by these huge schools of excellence. These Mega-Universities are often the size of large cities with their own economies and laws. With competition for research funding high, each race season is as much about showcasing the skills of the pilots as it is the performance of the craft.

In New York City, most people left. But some didn’t. Those people banded together into groups forming their own City-States. Italian immigrants in Little Italy formed the Mano Nera City-State, the police and government workers became the Tammany City-State and so on. Determined to survive and even thrive in this hostile environment, they turned to the sea for sustenance. What they could not provide themselves, they traded for with the “Mainlanders”. Fresh water pumped into the city through pipes. One day, the water stops flowing through the pipes. As the city watches it’s water reserves run lower and lower, it is you who will attempt to save them…FeaturesSuperb Story: Our game was penned by distinguished author and cartoonist Paul Noth. Neo-Victorian Setting: Steam technology has dominated all technological advances. Authenticity: Many aspects of 19th Century “Gilded Age” New York can be found in-game. Fast Tactics Combat System: Plan your attack in peace and then execute it in Real Time.Art of Barter System: Barter weapons for weapons with traders. No money allowed.Nerve System: Nervous characters will at times fail you. But there are medicines for that. Archetypes: Choose from four different archetypes to find the one that best fits your playstyle. Professions: Characters will have 19th Century Professions that modify their statistics.

Medicinal Items: Genuine Medical products, many of which contain poisonous substances. The GameEmpyre: Lords of the Sea Gates is a Role-Playing Game in the Classic sense. Our goal was to provide you with the familiar experience of looting, questing, character progression and more just like the old school games did. Aside from the graphical upgrade to the present day, we also wanted to forge our own path in the way we tell stories and the world we create for you. The 19th Century has a wealth of experiences to draw from that you don’t typically see in most games. That gives us a chance to give you something new. To give a few examples: Successful politicians were those with the largest gang of thugs and control over the Polling Stations. Workers Unions were coming of age around this time with frequent strikes and many times, strikebreakers. In gambling dens, dogs would fight rats. This is a sampling of some of the ideas we worked with in telling our stories. We also wanted you to feel that our world has a sense of Authenticity. In a flooded, Neo-Victorian version of New York, that sounds a little far-fetched. Yet, we did our research. You will meet real life figures from the era: Monk Eastman, Mock Dock, Silent Charlie Murphy. You will visit real life locations: The Tombs Prison, the Brooklyn Bridge. You will consume real life medicines when your party is in trouble: Goulard’s Extract, Hunt’s Remedy, Shoo-Fly Powder for Drunkenness. That is if you trust Victorian era medicine...

One does not get to set the rules in the world of Inner Chains. Humankind is just a small part of a hostile universe. Want to survive? Discover its secrets. A planet in the distant future. A rock floating in space that is no longer what it had once been. Without human interference, nature has been adapting to the new conditions, reclaiming what was once taken away. In its pursuit of perfection, it began to assimilate with the abandoned technology giving life to biomechanical beings. Left to its own devices, man-made technology has also changed as it tried to adjust to the new environment. A strong symbiosis soon developed between technology and nature. It became difficult to determine what is alive and what is mechanical in the world of Inner Chains. After several million years of biomechanical evolution, mankind once again became an important part of the ecosystem. However, it hasn’t regained an advanced stage of development. As a result, the human race, oblivious to its own history, cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planet’s resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith, dominance, oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes, and, in consequence, to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first, learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit. As one of the inhabitants of this world, your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated, dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal, but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival, face hostile fauna and flora, and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the game’s world.

The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area.

Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias. The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level.

Return of the Obra Dinn,return-of-the-obra-dinn,89.0,8.1,"Oct 18, 2018","{'3D', 'First-Person', 'Adventure'}",,"In 1802, the merchant ship ""Obra Dinn"" set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea. Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment. (""Obra"" is pronounced like ""Cobra"" without the C). From the author: Goals I want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical ""collect items and look for clues"" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later. Devlog I'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time. 1-bit Rendering My first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes. Unity 3D I'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/be1ff42b5502cbf46cc1e87dc88c0615-98.jpg

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.Fashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Fight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.Trade with passing ships and trade caravans.Decorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Build colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that!

The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.

This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series. Plot The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him. Gameplay The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There's also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time. Characters The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/544750/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/eccae4b67c42ed768366d0b7ec911b5a-98.jpg

Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.You won’t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.The question we’ve asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruinsGather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruinsDive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progressA detailed and beautifully dot-rendered worldSeven main weapons and over ten sub-weaponsOver 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruinsOver 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer’s tablet, the ""Mobile Super X3""Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the gameLumisa Kosugi(21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist)Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child.

If you are not sure if you like the combat we implemented - before you buy - please check some YT clips or visit our YT channel, where we uploaded the combat gameplay recorded and commented by an actual player. This is not a turn-based combat, rather a combination of RPG and RTS on a small scale, where you have the ability to slow time at will.On Hard difficulty the game is meant to be hard, requiring your undivided attention throughout the entire combat encounter.On Epic difficulty - there is only one party/skill/item composition for each enemy/boss type that we know of - one mistake will likely wipe your party. You must be in full control of the battle every second. Experimentation and thinking outside-of-the-box will ensure your success here.Features: Engaging story – set in a world where technology met magic with devastating consequences. Hundreds of lore books and scattered pieces of information slowly reveal the history of Artara as the protagonist approaches his fate. Novel combat system – unique real-time action with a slow-time feature, where each match is played on one of many separate tactical maps. Plan ahead and position your party accordingly. Use slow-time to react to new threats or negate enemy skills. No two encounters are ever the same. Five difficulty levels: You can choose whether you want only to enjoy the story or test your tactical thinking and skills. Build your party around typical tank/dps/support composition or try something entirely new. Different combat scenarios - e.g. Swarm or Only Elite - will ensure that combat is not repetitive. Find secret locations, cleverly hidden in the environment. Travel through hand-crafted levels where every single place is carefully designed. Seven classes to choose from, and your party can be adjusted at will and anytime, depending on the challenges you face. Each champion has unique skills that can be upgraded and re-trained at will. (In Early Access six champions are available, as the seventh joins your party at lower levels). New character progression system: there is no experience to gain. Instead, discover ancient knowledge to unlock new skills and carefully design your characters. Each character could be turned into a powerful and durable attacker or a skill-based champion. Defeat powerful elite enemies (bosses) wielding diverse skills and spells. Assess their strengths and weaknesses carefully to succeed. Complete combat challenges for item rewards and unique enchanting recipes, or just to test your new party setup. Random loot system. Craft item of your choice and power, using crafting crystals of various types. Discover ancient enchanting recipes that can change the nature of the combat, granting regeneration aura or immunity to special effects.

Bereft of his past, Adol explores the town he happened to wander into, searching for any clues at all to his identity. Joined by a thief who claims to have spent some time at his side these past weeks, the young adventurer helps rescue doomed miners from a collapse – an act which ingratiates him to the local Romun Army general.

It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again. What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend.

Together, they meander through what seems to be a peaceful, monotonous existence in their sleepy little burg where nothing interesting ever happens.Until something does, anyway! A mysterious masked figure shows up one night and steals six holy idols from the local shrine. The self-proclaimed “Archduke of Arges” tenders a hefty reward for their return, and our “brave” duo jumps at the chance to go find them – Pokkle for the glory, and Pipiro strictly for the cash moneys.Their journey will take them to every last nook and cranny across the land and lead to confrontations with a wide variety of friends and foes, each more ludicrous than the last, as a sinister plot to revive an ancient “Demon Lord” unfolds and 500 years’ worth of history comes into focus.

Although released on several different platforms in Japan over the years, this is the first time it’s ever been officially released in English, and is the most feature-complete version of the game to date.So what are you waiting for?

During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation.

Le scénario change constamment selon les choix du joueur, pouvant même causer la mort des personnages. Mais la partie ne s'arrêtera pas pour autant. Bien au contraire, l'histoire se poursuivra en incluant la mort du personnage en question et vous devrez en assumer les conséquences. Dans Ash of Gods, le combat combine la stratégie classique au tour par tour avec des éléments de jeu de cartes. Les tactiques individuelles varieront en fonction des compétences et de la classe de vos personnages et vous pourrez débloquer et collectionner des cartes capables d'activer des capacités spéciales qui peuvent renverser le cours du combat. CE QUI FAIT D'ASH OF GODS UN JEU UNIQUE Des décisions lourdes de conséquences Chaque décision, à la fois hors et sur le champ de bataille, peut altérer le cours des événements et changer le destin de vos personnages, ce qui engendrera de lourdes conséquences. Mais sachez que même la mort de l'un de vos héros ne mettra pas fin à votre aventure. Rien n'est décidé au hasard Ce n'est pas le hasard qui déterminera vos chances de réussite ou la force d'un coup.

L'HISTOIRE Au bout de 700 ans, la vie paisible de Terminus touche à sa fin. La fête de l'équinoxe de printemps bat son plein lorsque le clocher de la ville retentit. Le capitaine Thorn Brenin, le garde du corps Lo Pheng, le scribe Hopper Rouley et beaucoup d'autres ne savent pas encore que les moissonneurs sont revenus et ont l'intention de mettre le monde à feu et à sang afin de réveiller les dieux endormis. Écrit par Sergey Malitsky, auteur de fantasy récompensé, Ash of Gods est un jeu doté d'un riche scénario, de personnages charismatiques, de dialogues poignants et d'un univers incroyable. Malitsky travaille à l'heure actuelle sur un nouveau roman, basé sur les événements d'Ash of Gods. L'ART GRAPHIQUE Inspiré du travail de Ralph Bakshi (Le Seigneur des Anneaux), des animations classiques de Disney et du célèbre studio soviétique Soyuzmultfilm (La Reine des Neiges), Ash of Gods offre des illustrations et des animations détaillées, dessinées à la main. Le rotoscoping, une technique où chaque scène est filmée au préalable avec un véritable acteur comme modèle, donne vie aux animations qui fourmillent de détails et de dynamisme. LA MUSIQUE La bande originale est un travail collaboratif entre Adam Skorupa, Krzysztof Wierzynkiewicz et Michal Cielecki qui ont travaillé par le passé sur The Witcher, Bulletstorm, Painkiller, EVE Online, Call of Juarez et Shadow Warrior.

Fable Fortune,fable-fortune,63.0,8.0,"Feb 21, 2018","{'Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Tactics'}",,"Fable Fortune is a game of Choice and Consequence. Play as one of six unique Heroes in a card game with fast-paced and thrilling tactical gameplay. Join our Early Access to receive Exclusive rewards including the Fabled Card - Giant Egg, Exclusive Trophy Card - Chicken Vengeant, and 20 Card Packs (Plus an extra 10 as a bonus when you start playing) At the start of a match, you must choose your quest. Completing quests earns unique rewards which can help turn the tide of battle. On completing a Quest, you must choose, Good or Evil? Turning to Good or Evil changes the abilities your hero can use, but also the powers and properties of your cards. This means you can react to your opponent, changing your strategy and the cards in your hand based on the choices you make. Fable Fortune has been designed from the ground up around 2 player co-op. Team up with a friend or stranger to learn the game, working together to take down challenging Raid Bosses. In Co-op mode, you take turns to fight, but you share each others units. For the hardest challenges, you’ll need to work closely with an ally, designing decks and picking heroes which synergize with each other. Beat bosses to earn exclusive prizes and rewards. Different Arenas have different Quests and Rewards, changing the battlefield. Every week, you’ll see special events with entirely different rules. Only moustaches allowed? Max power mode? Hatch an Egg each time you use your hero power? We aim to have an ever changing, evolving meta which rewards experimentation and puts a focus on strategy and skill. Matches in Fable Fortune start with 3 Gold, meaning it’s straight into the action quickly. For each deck you create, you can pick a special ‘Trophy’ card which you’ll receive if you’re playing second, to get things off to a strong start. Fable Fortune allows you to defend any unit on the battlefield with the ‘Guard’ feature. Because any unit can protect your Hero, this open up a huge range of deck-building strategy and possibilities. Choose to protect yourself, or your most powerful units. Some units have special abilities which will trigger when they’re placed into Guard. We’ve focused on minimizing randomness in the game; emphasizing skill and strategy. On top of any purchases you make, you’ll start the game with 10 Card Packs. This includes a Guaranteed Fabled Card. The first time you play a hero, you’ll get two packs, and can gain more than 50 just for levelling heroes. We’ll regularly be rewarding new and interesting cards for taking part in Events, Co-op or PvP. Whether you choose to spend money or not; we want the game to be enjoyable and competitive. We’re a small, passionate development team. We’ve chosen to go into Early Access as we want to get the community involved in the development of the game. We need your support, advice and help to make this the best card game around. Involving you, the community, in the design process is really important to us and we’ll be running community designed and driven events and competitions in the game as we move forward.

X4: Foundations,x4-foundations,59.0,6.4,"Nov 30, 2018","{'Action Adventure', 'General'}",,"Freedom to personally fly all ships: X4 will allow you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. Additionally some drones and utility vehicles in X4 can be remotely controlled by the player. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Modular stations and ship upgrades: Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Most dynamic X universe ever: X4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe. Managing your empire with a powerful map: Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Most detailed X economy ever: One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and Teleportation: The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders. Get into the game: In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever.

It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series. Setting The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore. Gameplay Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time.

Bullet Witch,bullet-witch,51.0,5.0,"Apr 25, 2018","{'Arcade', 'Third-Person', 'Shooter', 'Action'}",,"First, there was the earthquake. Then the war, then the plague, then the riots. In the span of a few short years, humanity suffered every disaster imaginable — and all as a prelude to the one we couldn't have imagined. An army of literal demons marched straight out of Hell, trampling over the survivors wherever they found them. When they killed, they wore their victims' skins. When they conquered, they seized their enemies' weapons. Powered by supernatural evil and loaded with military hardware, they scattered us and ran us down. But then she came. At first, we thought she was one of them — a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will. Maybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ First released on the Xbox 360 in 2006, Bullet Witch offered a unique combination of Japanese dark-fantasy aesthetics and Western-style military action. This PC re-release brings the title to a new generation of gamers, improving the resolution, framerate, lighting, and game balance. After an army of demons takes over the world, the human resistance is on the brink of collapse. Just when all hope seems lost, a woman in black appears on the battlefield. She possesses a long gun like a witch's broom and an array of magical powers to match. Taking on the role of this mysterious savior, Alicia, you’ll fight through hordes of demon soldiers, mutated civilians, and even giants.KEY FEATURES This Is My Broomstick Alicia's gunrod can transform on the fly into four different weapons, each of which can be enchanted for extra punch and special perks. Mow down enemies to charge your magic meter, then can call down thunderbolts, tornadoes, and even meteors to blast the rest of them to kingdom come. Few gaming heroines have ever wielded as much raw power as Alicia at her peak. The Path of Destruction Nothing is safe from your wrath, least of all the environment around you. Your magic can tear the roofs off of buildings, ignite an entire gas station, or level towers. If any enemies survive, use your telekinesis on the rubble to throw it at them and crush them flat. You Are Not Alone Your strength and bravery will inspire the battle-hardened resistance fighters around you, and soon enough, they'll fight by your side. Use your magic to keep them alive, and they just might return the favor. All DLC Included The PC release of Bullet Witch includes all the original game's costumes and bonus missions for free.

This is not a story-driven MMO experience with AI enemies and deep NPC narratives, rather the PVE features in WWO are designed to enrich the PVP experience with social roleplaying, farming, mining, crafting, homesteading and quests.FACTION WARFAREPick either the ruthless McFarlane Family or their calculating rival Steele Industries, and join the clan war for control of Rosewell County and all its bountiful resources. Pick a clan and participate in this feud: fight for the honor of the company, help settle scores, and most importantly defend your own territory while seizing land and resources away from your rival.PUBLIC SHOWDOWNSYour mettle will be further tested through public PVP combat events. Fight against all comers, alone or teamed with friends. The rewards rich, but the opposition is fierce. Only the toughest and cleverest will walk away with the loot. Daily events let you hone your skills in preparation for exclusive, high-value events.LARGE WORLD OF WILD WEST TO EXPLORE Wild West World exploration will take you through a variety of gorgeous biomes, each with its own charms – and dangers. Plains, forest, desert and mountains can all be found in Wild West Online. And like the pioneers of yore, you can map out new territories looking for the perfect claim or homestead, or you can take a different path when your wanderings lead you into one of WWO’s various settlements.BECOME A SEASONED HANDThe more you play, the more you'll level-up and progress your character. Not only will you build-out your skill tree, but you'll unlock new gear and be able to upgrade and modify your weapons in order to dominate the frontier. And character progression in WWO isn’t a locked to a rigid class system, but rather you put time and skill points towards what excites you the most.SOCIAL ROLEPLAYINGPerhaps you’re a gunslinger type, drawn to combat? Spend your time and points in that area. Are you more of a craft-and-sell type? The shops eagerly await your wares. Or perhaps you’d like to stick to the wilderness, adventuring for cash, or simply exploring this new frontier? Social roleplaying with your friends allows you to try different role playing games - you can choose the righteous path of being a Sheriff, and find yourself beholden to the laws of the land. Or you can opt for the dangerous freedom of running as an outlaw. All these things are possible in Wild West Online.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/743860/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/252242c38f0be3d444d2ef3f1c5236a9-98.jpg

Plot Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth's surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series' canon). Gameplay The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons.

Dead or Alive 6,dead-or-alive-6,73.0,4.8,"Mar 1, 2019","{'Fighting', '3D', 'Action'}",M,"[Introduce DOA Series] The Dead or Alive franchise is a AAA fighting game series produced by Koei Tecmo Games' Team NINJA. Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original Dead or Alive in 1996, Dead or Alive 6 will be the sixth entry in the series. This game features fighting entertainment with multi-tiered stages that are now both dynamic and critical parts of the competitive experience. [Story] The story will follow that of Dead or Alive 5, shedding light on 2 main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the tournament “Dead or Alive 6”. New episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] The visuals of DOA6 express dramatic lighting that goes beyond the genre of “fighting games” and focus on serious, intense combat. It also features improved skin and sweat textures, introducing wounds, as well as flexible, varied facial animations. [Triangle System] Fights in Dead or Alive 6 are based on a Traditional triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. When you land an attack of one type that beats another type, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, that attack becomes a Hi Counter attack and does even more damage. [Break Actions - New Combat Mechanics] With this title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, making the fights more strategic than ever before. Because the actions can be performed by simply pressing the [RB] button, even beginners can enjoy the new system. [Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks the opponent away. The first part of the move also parries attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] Players can achieve unique combos by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. Beginners can even play by using this move exclusively, though its disadvantages will prove to be a calculated risk for more experienced players.[New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked into a large stack of nearby boxes with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush”, they will plow through them all in one hit! This causes a huge burst of damage and provides an exhilarating rush.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/838380/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/71f0ca52c161d1e7e9702573136ef179-98.jpg

Felix the Reaper,felix-the-reaper,71.0,7.7,"Oct 17, 2019","{'General', 'Adventure'}",T,"Felix works at The Ministry of Death and is in love with Betty The Maiden from The Ministry of Life. He believes that going to the human world as a field reaper will enable him to one day meet her. Hence he’s taken the job of making sure people die and taught himself to dance to impress Betty. Since Felix only moves in the shadows, he needs to manipulate those shadows to move around. Luckily reapers like Felix are able to turn the sun and move shadowing objects, which enables him to create the necessary shadow paths to get around. He does so to solve the adventure plots, that makes people die according to the ministerial plans. Each level unlocks a hardcore version of itself for the striving ministerial achiever. You can also collect skull achievements, that further unlock bonus time trials for the extremely resourceful ministerial employee. • Challenge yourself to original puzzle game mechanics • Experience a gruesomely sweet and beautiful story world • Choose your own tune from a selection of 10+ indie music artists on Felix‘ Walkman • Collect skull achievements that further unlock bonus time trials • Watch Felix‘ dance moves develop as created by professional dancers Felix The Reaper has sprung from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. The history contains both The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden as two central themes going through it. We sort of mashed those two together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him the inspiration was more diverse: in that aspect, the game contains inspiration from the ancient tv-show The Twilight Zone, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki. Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper were the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We've worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and historian scholars.The DanceSeveral dancers have been around throughout the production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves, that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix: And here's Raphael doing another: The MusicOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music - why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. That makes for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.The Art HistoryThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis and then asked ourselves: how can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. Parallel to the production a historical scholar has dived into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it in the game, if it fit. There's five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game, that you can unlock as you progress.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/919410/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/1786b842378e1f0e0bc98dde85f43e75-98.jpg

It's a unique, atmospheric, single-player narrative experience, set in a rich, fully licensed, globally recognized universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition. Choose your character from one of several distinct Clans Every playable character offers unique powers (Disciplines), different ethical approaches to certain issues, and dialogue lines Character-oriented quests allow you to create your own coterie and shape your relations by reinforcing NPC loyalties Highly replayable - choices made in the game are reflected by the game's changing fiction Various endings depending on your actions - which conclusion will you reach? Suitable for both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and fans of mature narrative-driven games who are newcomers to the setting The game does justice to the mature themes of the World of Darkness, and takes advantage of the excellent atmosphere of the source material. It also creates new stories, which, thanks to the full creative license, will be incorporated as official lore of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.What is Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York? Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York aims to translate the complex and fascinating world of vampires, their nightly struggles for power and attempts to hold on to their humanity, to a format previously unexplored by the brand - an atmospheric narrative experience. Think interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas, answers to which are entirely up to the players, allowing them to reach one of a variety of possible endings.How does Coteries of New York play? You act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you’ll meet different NPCs – other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You’ll build your Coterie and learn your undead companions’ deepest secrets… or see them abandon you. You’ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity and will feel the constant lure of the Beast inside you. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You’ll be able to use Disciplines to charm, sneak, intimidate or kill and your choices will determine your path.If it’s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...? Yes, exactly! Coteries of New York is set in a fully licensed universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition! However, even if you know nothing about the setting, don't fret! The game is designed to meet the expectations of both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and new players, who never had an opportunity to delve into the World of Darkness.What about replayability and post-launch support? You’ll be able to choose your character from three different vampires, representing three iconic Camarilla Clans (we’ll unveil them at a later date). Every character has access to a different set of Disciplines (unique supernatural skills that are characteristic to that Clan) and different narration. Your initial choice also influences your Coterie members’ approach to you, dialogue lines, possible side quests etc. Hence, it takes hours to experience every piece of content we prepared. You’ll go through the main quest, side quests and loyalty quests (aimed to build closer relations between the protagonist and members of your Coterie). BUT one playthrough is definitely not enough to see every piece of content we’ve prepared. As for post-launch support, you can definitely expect new, standalone stories, enriching the lore, telling different bloody stories from the history of vampiric New York and adding new twists to interpersonal plots.Which platforms will Coteries of New York be available on? Coteries of New York will be available on PC (Windows, MAC OS, Linux) and Nintendo Switch. The game will launch on both platforms simultaneously. Other platforms, like PS4 and Xbox One, are not out of the question, but we're taking a ""wait and see"" approach.When will Coteries of New York be released? Coteries of New York will be released in Q4 2019! We’ll unveil the final date when we’re closer to launch.Which language versions will be supported? That's a huge and very difficult topic because of localisation costs and time constraints. We understand that Vampire: The Masquerade has fans all over the world and we would like Coteries of New York to be available in many different languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese. We'll be able to share more information closer to launch.Will the game support controllers? Yes!

Get to know it, winning the affection of the locals and gaining allies, or try to carve your own path alone. Explore the Town, its inhabitants, and their traditions; fight both the plague itself and its victims; try to make a difference before the time runs out. Figure out who killed your father while fighting a deadly plague. Find your alleged twin sister. Was she the one who had brought the plague to this town? The local kids are hiding something. Try playing by their rules. You only have 12 days. 12 days in an odd town ravaged by a deadly disease. Time is of the essence: if you don’t manage it carefully, it’ll simply run out. You’ll have to choose how to spend the priceless minutes you have. Survival thriller. You’ll have to manage your bodily functions, offsetting hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and so on. But it doesn’t boil down to scavenging resources. Surviving on your own is hard; you’ll have to win over allies. An uphill battle. Managing your bodily parameters may seem bearable at first, but as time goes by, it becomes harder and harder. Your own body is only waiting for an opportunity to give up and betray you. Things are changing from bad to worse and the odds are stacked against you. A duel with an enemy you can’t kill. Your main foe is the plague itself, an incorporeal and malevolent entity that you have to defeat… without having the means to. It’s more powerful and more treacherous than you can imagine. Loot, murder, mug, steal, barter, beg… or don’t. You need resources to survive, but it’s up to you how to obtain them. The fights are short, ungraceful, and vicious. They don’t have to be lethal though.

Truberbrook: A Nerd Saves the World,truberbrook-a-nerd-saves-the-world,66.0,4.5,"Mar 12, 2019","{'General', 'Adventure'}",,"»Trüberbrook« is a thrilling mystery-sci-fi adventure game. Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery. Imagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world … Suspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all, it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained! Join American student Tannhauser, stranger in a strange land Set in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s Inspired by Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Stranger Things & Star Trek Indulge in universal themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, self-discovery and dinosaurs Handmade miniature scenery! English and German localization with full voice acting! Atmospheric, moody soundtrack Coming to Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation®4 & Nintendo Switch A likely mobile port later! Up to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay! Release scheduled for late 2018 – not the longest wait! Trüberbrook was successfully funded on Kickstarter in December 2017 within only 30 hours. The game will be enhanced by several new features thanks to the joint force of our 5078 wonderful backers! <3 The year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin. On a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, Trüberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity. But shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why? Gradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Gretchen Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Gretchen becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world! As the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft. Tannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature. Tannhauser is played by Justin Beard. Gretchen Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village. Gretchen Lemke is played by Nora Tschirner. As much a reclusive inventor as it gets, Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft? Lazarus Taft is played by Dirk von Lowtzow. Trüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, ""the weird kid"" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few. One of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers! Not the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made. The models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters. It is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done! Every scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke. This way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook. Trüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative. You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests. For the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation. The soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits, Angelo Badalamenti, Mark Lanegan, Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader. We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors. In the international English version, the main character Tannhauser speaks American English, while the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport a (more or less) German accent. In the German version, it's vice versa: the protagonist might have a modest American accent, while the townspeople welcome him in regular German, most likely with a dialect. Both approaches bear a certain degree of entertainment, each in their own way.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/757300/,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/e3b651a8665bf0b7583be3a7efa29640-98.jpg

The prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics. With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.

Gameplay is fast and frenetic with an emphasis on thwarting other players with dirty tricks at every turn. Be a mercenary and compete for loot, or take on the role of a massive monster and try to kill everything in your path. The first player to collect the biggest haul and reach the evac zone wins - unless the player controlling the big baddy gets them all first.Work with other mercenaries to survive, but remember: only the player with the most loot wins. Should you combine forces against the terrifying monster, or sneak away to make bank while everyone else is busy? Mercenaries cannot directly harm each other, but they can use the environment and a selection of potent gadgets to outwit their opponents. Maybe lock a door at the right moment to trap another player in the same room as the monster, or use a gadget to suck the loot away from everyone around you. Just remember, what goes around comes around.Each round, one player is selected to play as a massive creature with a simple goal: kill everyone. You won't stand a chance if the mercenaries band together, so it's up to you to divide and conquer.

Fade to Silence,fade-to-silence,57.0,4.7,"Apr 30, 2019","{'Survival', 'Action Adventure'}",M,"As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons. “You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today. The wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?” Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming. “You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws. Then you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice? Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area. Wolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long term expeditions into the farthest regions. Fight System: Tiered weapon system, melee and ranged combat.

Grimshade,grimshade,53.0,6.0,"Mar 26, 2019","{'General', 'Role-Playing'}",,"Grimshade is a story-driven tactical RPG featuring a turn-based combat system and non-linear progression, set in a fantasy world. Lead a group of adventurers on a journey through the world of Ree'Fah. Each decision you make has a profound influence on the characters, the game's story and the way battles are fought. Explore a varied and intricate world, meet new characters, reveal plot-related secrets and go treasure hunting; the world around changes as you advance and directs you further through the story. Proper positioning and awareness contribute more to your success than stat gains; Control the character's performance during battles through party and equipment management available outside the battlefield; Large locations full of quests, secrets, dangers, and rewards for the player to explore; A living world where the environment, characters, and animations are hand-drawn and carefully put together by our artists, sets the atmosphere of your journey. A branching narrative, that makes the game's progress depend strongly on your choices; Gameplay Grimshade is a fabulous adventure during which you explore a vast and rich world and fight formidable enemies. The gameplay is divided into two distinct phases - adventure and combat. Adventure Adventure mode is your exciting journey through Ree'Fah world. As well as progressing the story at your own pace, you will discover different races, acquire better equipment and meet new characters. You are free to move within the area and choose your destinations: it's up to you to decide whether to go to the nearest city or to look around in the current location, to complete some quests (and which ones) or to test your strength in a difficult dungeon. After completing all the plot-related quests, you leave the area to the next and never come back. Unique residents with rich history inhabit each area you visit. Embrace the spirit of the local culture and spend your time interacting with the natives — you are sure to find something to help you on your main quest or discover a whole new adventure to go on. Of course, when the stakes are this high, conflict is unavoidable, so prepare for battle by choosing the right tools for the job - find, trade for, or craft a wide range of equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable. Combat system We spent a lot of time and effort developing our unique approach to battles and making them as interesting and exciting as possible. Any unexpected turn of events can get you into a fight. The world is also inhabited by a lot of hostile creatures that you will have to defeat in the course of events. At the start, you will have to pick a squad from your character's team including up to 4 members. The battle takes place on a stage consisting of two opposite fields, where characters and enemies are located on their respective sides. Characters move and act in a specific order according to their initiative. We developed a unique scenario for each battle. Each new enemy has their own features diversifying the fights and making you experiment and seek new approaches to succeed in the combat encounters. Naturally, each new battle requires more skill than the previous one. We have not forgotten about the tactical battles lovers. Some locations in Grimshade include special missions - hostile dungeons of a higher level of complexity. Here, every encounter with the boss turns into a mortal game of wits. Think over your strategy and prepare a squad that will be able to go through the dungeon in one go. In the end, you'll get a well-deserved reward! Heroes Although Grimshade is a single-player game, you won't be traveling alone. Advancing through the story, you'll get acquainted with seven heroes. Their personalities, focus, and backgrounds are pre-set, but you can control their skills and develop the relationship between the party members. We hope to add another hero soon after reaching one of the goals, and the script of the game suggests twelve of them. Story After the Great Flood, being torn apart by the heirs of Amon Darvish the Great and long-running civil war, the Kingdom of Easeon split into three states. Ree'Fah witnessed the dark age for both livs and eleores. Nevertheless, after years of wandering, each group of people still managed to find a haven from the dreadful lands of the Hardfore continent, inhabited by monsters. Amazing technologies, the legacy of ancestors, secret knowledge of the world's nature, great and splendid objectives of the future were lost forever during battles for survival and hard work on settling the new society on the ruins of ancient cities, hostile wastelands, and dangerous mountain highlands. Eighty years have passed. When old wounds almost healed and people just embarked on the road to prosperity, new enemy forces gained the power to enter the scene, threatening the fragile stability of every living creature's life in the world. Art During one and a half years of development, the visual component of Grimshade has changed a lot. From a stylized watercolor environment with 2D characters, we moved on to adding 3D models of characters to the 2D world, creating our own shader, and a detailed environment. Our artists drew the whole game by hand and carefully put it together, that's why the world of Ree'Fah is full of life even in the most secluded corners.

Super Sexy Software started in spirit in 2013, when the first echoes of The Shattering started to take form. The project began from studying the contrast of white and black in horror and culture. The core theme draws on the premise that horrors and fear can be achieved through embracing white and the absence of information, rather than darkness and the obvious, though unseen, enemy.Over various iterations, the game took shape and the decision was made to work on it in every spare moment that could be found. With members of the team residing in Poland, France and Switzerland, they grew in experience and efficiency as the true spirit of the studio was born. As the game progressed, the developers and Deck13 met at a networking event and the synergy between the companies resonated immediately. A publisher was found, and all the ingredients to finish The Shattering were ready.With the full development spanning multiple years, births and deaths, tears and laughter, the only joy greater than that of the journey together as one team and family, is the joy of seeing The Shattering take shape and be played by people around the world.
